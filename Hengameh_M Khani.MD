My name is Hengameh Mohammadkhani and Iam CYF trainee.
My favourite sport is jogging.Its a kind of aerobic exercise that comes from physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose and body fat.Its really help me to burn calories,reduce body fat,weight loss and improve your body composition.
My favourite food is an Adas poolo ,a traditional Iranian food.Adas in Farsi means lentil and poolo means rice.SO its clear that its a dish that has lentil and rice in it.Honestly I dont know why I like this food as a favourite one,but its obvious that lentil is full of nutritious,potassium and Iron.
MY favourite music is One million years ago by Adele.https://youtu.be/Db9ciJPIaEU
