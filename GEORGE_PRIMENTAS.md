Hello! My name is George Primentas.
My favourite (practicing) sport is running (mostly endurance running).
I like it because it's simple, inexpensive, and flexible in terms of goal setting. 
I'm not particularly fussy about food as long as it's vegan. I like ovened potatoes and houmous
The Beatles is by far my favourite band and (almost) any kind of music [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-rB0pHI9fU ] they have touched is good enough for me. Weirdly though, I like modern country music best (as a single genre) [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiBinM-f-Pk ].
