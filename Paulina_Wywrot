My name is Paulina Wywrot.
My favourite sport is swimming, I like it because it helps me to relax, also I feel comfortable in the water.
I love Italian food, because it's simple, tasty, healthy and affordable.

One of my favourite artists is Sara Bareilles. I especially like to listen to her live performances.

An interesting fact about me is that I love singing and I play the piano.
