Hi, my name is Franklin Alexander Perez Torres
I am from El Salvador, a small country from Central America.
I am 28 y/o and I speak Spanish.

My favourite sport is Basketball, (Oh My God I love it so much) I used to play in a national team
when I was 12, I played for 4 years with that team in my country.
My favourite team is "Golden State Warriors" the won the championship this year against boston celtics.
I really like basketball because you have a lot of control of the ball with your hands so you can do a lot of tricks 
with your hands when whenever you shoot to the net it feels amazing.

When it comes to Food I - L O V E - M E X I C A N - F O O D .
the taste, the flavor, spicy , sweet, so many factors that mexican food have, 
my favourite one is a Taco al pastor that  is a pork taco with pineapple, its so so delicious.

Talk about music is more complicated than talking about food or sport for me, because I do play some music instruments, I love a lot of genders of music so it is so complicated to decide one, it depends on my mood basically 
but today today, I catch with "Tierra Zanta"= it means holly land of "trueno" an argentinian raper
