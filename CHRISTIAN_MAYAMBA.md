Hi, my name is Christian Mayamba. I’m a big fan of soccer. To me, it’s the king of sports. It brings people together, it’s fast-paced, and there’s nothing like the energy of a good match.

When it comes to food, nothing beats a good boerewors; it’s flavorful, filling, and reminds me of home. If you're ever firing up a braai, count me in!

Musically, here’s a link to one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMAM2lbUxQU. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.

And here’s a fun fact: I can still install Windows XP from scratch, drivers and all. It's my unofficial tech party trick!
