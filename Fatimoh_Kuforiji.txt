My name is Kuforiji Fatimoh Yetunde, I am from Nigeria. I have a bachelor and master's degree in History and International Studies, and I have a 
couple of years work experience. However, since I moved to Uk, I have been considering a career change. When I started developing interest in programming, 
I decided that I would like to have a career switch. In this modern world, technology keeps evolving and I see programming as the future of information technology.   
This career switch has been made easier and possible, thanks to Code Your Future.


I love table tennis game. I play it at any given opportunity. I love the game because it has to do with eyes coordination and mental calculation. 
It also exercises all part of the body.

My favorite food is Amala and Ewedu, both are native to Nigeria. Amala is made from yam flour while Ewedun is a kind of vegetable that is chopped and boiled. 
Ewedu is known as Molokhia is Asia and Middle East. Ewedu is rich in fibre and Amala is a carbohydrate. 

I love listening to the recitation of the Holy Qur'an because they are words of Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. It continually reminds me of the purpose of our existence on earth. 
Listening to the Qur'an helps in memorizing its verses and also helps with retention. Here is a link of one of my favorite reciters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhnrnjXoO0&list=PLxpAkjlGauHdUcO_uc-8F8J2NUQRDZjPG&ab_channel=QuranicRecitations 

My hubbies are cooking, sewing, writing, being children and spending time  with my family.

Thank you.
