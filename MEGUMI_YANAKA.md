Hi, my name is Megumi. 
I prefer to be called "Linlin" by my friends.

My favourite sport is motorsports and dance and any kind of sports using half-pipe. 
I like them because they are so beautiful.

My favorite food is Sushi because I love raw fish. 
(You can eat more than 50 kind of Sushi in Japan.)

I love any kind of music! 
Especially club music played by DJ as live set in a party though...
I will choose this tonight!â™ª
