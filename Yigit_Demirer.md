Hi, my name is Yigit Demirer.
I like trekking which is my favourite sport as I like being in the nature and keeps my body strong, fit and flexible.
I tend do eat spicy food and Indian cuisine is one of my favourite. Heavy doses of spices and flavours taste really good to me.
Here is the link for one of the videos I love the most. I think it's an audiovisual masterpiece.

I learned how to skydive when I was 15 years old. Jumped out of the plane 7 times by myself.
