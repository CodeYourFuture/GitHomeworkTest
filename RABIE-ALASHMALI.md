Hi My name is Rabie Khaled Al-Ashmali.
I love football, I enjoy playing and watching it, it has always part of my life since I was a baby. I have grown into loving this sport.
I like almost all kind of food so it is really hard to have a favourite. However, I really like burgers I don't mind eating burgers all day long.
I mostly listen to Hip-Hop and rap music so here is one of the songs I like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anI5b2PEmdA 
An interesting fact about myself would be that I played football for the Yemeni national team under 17 before coming to the UK.
