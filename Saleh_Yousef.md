Hi, my name is Saleh O. Yousef.

One of my favourite sports is paragliding. I love it because of the breathtaking sceneryâ€”soaring high above landscapes, catching glimpses of rolling hills and valleys.

I would say prawns are my favourite food; theyâ€™re just tasty whether grilled or cooked with pasta. ðŸ˜‹

Interesting fact about me: I speak **four languages**! Ask me which ones when you see me.
