My name is Aaishah Okunade, a trainee at CodeYourFuture
I love skipping and this is because every part of my body gets to participate in the exercise
My favorite food is Rice, it is easy to cook and has got various ways of cooking it
Here is a link to the video of a favorite music of mine https://youtu.be/AhJANTppEJw
An interesting fact about me is that I love to cook but I don't eat much.
