Hi there!
My name is Joy Omodiale, and I love Tennis. I've always liked the outfits the ladies wear, the style of the sport and I love Serena!
My favorite food is not common in the UK, it's called Pounded Yam and Egusi - it's like a meatball but made of yam instead which is dipped in melon soup. Simply tasty!
Who doesn't love MJ - https://youtu.be/jQY_QL_wvQU this is my favourite song!
I'm all bits of interesting, I think! Lol! But one thing I can say is I love travelling but I hate flying on planes which is a stark contrast.
