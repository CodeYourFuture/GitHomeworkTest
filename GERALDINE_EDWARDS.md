## 🏅 About Me

- **Sports**: So when it comes to sport I don't do much of it personally (I don't mind a jog 🏃‍♀️ or a swim 🏊‍♀️ in the local leisure centre now and again) but I can appreciate lots of sports. I don't have a particular favourite, but in terms of sporting events I love the Olympic and Paralympic Games 🏅 - I wholeheartedly admire the competitors, their spirit, their skill and their commitment.

- **Food**: When it comes to food, I like a whole variety of cuisines:
 (Japanese 🍣, Italian 🍝, Mexican 🌯, plus many more!), however I am quite health conscious so I tend to try to eat certain healthier low fat 🌽, 🥕, high protein 🍄 meals as much as possible. But I do still give in to the best treat there is... yes, it's pizza 🍕, and also having a sweet tooth means that I enjoy a bit of chocolate 🍫 pretty much every day (only a small piece of course!)

- **Music**: I love ❤️ music, I listen to all kinds. Music to me is very closely related to feelings and memories and I have so many favourites from over the years that it would talk me years to tell you about them all 😀 so instead I will add a link to a song that I have always adored that takes me back to my youth!
It's a song by John Farnham, that was released in 1986 (giving my age away there!), and is called You're The Voice, it still gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. ❤️

## 🎉 Fun Facts About Me

I'm actually not sure if I am that interesting enough that you will be impressed but I will share a few unique things about me... 😀
- One is that I am a twin, 👯‍♀️ I have a twin sister who is 23 and a half minutes older than me (she likes to make sure we include the half minute!). We were born as identical twins however over the years we have definitely changed and look quite different from each other nowadays. 
- Also, although we are English and spent most of our lives in England, we can speak Welsh (our dad is Welsh) and for 6 years we went to Welsh speaking schools when we lived in Wales briefly.
- I suppose, one interesting thing is that I am hoping to become a Commonwealth Games volunteer at the next games in Glasgow, Scotland in 2026 (waiting to go through the approval process) which I am so excited about! I was inspired after the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games last year as everyone looked like they were having so much fun, and I thought why not have a go myself? So fingers corssed for that!
