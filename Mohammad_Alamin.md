    Hi I am Mohammad Alamin 

    My favourite sport and why I like it - My favourite sports is Football. I love watching or playing football. Its the most exciting and entertaning game in the world, and its the most popular sports in the world too. There is another word for football is the 'Beautiful Game' 
    means its beautiful to play, watch also to unite people from different culture, background and nation. Regardless of what part of the world you are in, the passion for the sport remains the same. Footbal is Inexpensive to play (not indicating about teams , but for general people)
    Another great thing about football is that it can Be played in virtually any type of condition. Football improves physical and mental stemina for children but also for adults. And most importantly its easy to understand and fun to watch. 

    My favourite food and why it's my favourite - My favourite food is Biryani. Its a traditional mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with  spices, rice, and meat usually that of chicken, goat, lamb, prawn, fish, and sometimes, in addition, eggs or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties. 
    I love Biryani Because Its has a rich flavour and texture, also great teaste when cooked properly with marinated meat. Its be cooked spicy or sweetened, depends on how someone like. 

    A link to a video of your favourite music - I am not a kind of person who put on his headphones everytime uses public transport or walk on the street, but I often listen to a song if my heart and mind feels like its nice and has good rhythm. If I like a song (does not matter if its a new music or I am late to discover a old music) I usually listen to it repeated using loops until I get bored of that, which means could last for few days haha.

    An interesting fact about myself is - I like to help people in need, I love doing charity work and making changes to peoples life who are strugling to meet basic needs, suffering from disadvantage situation, often ignored and has limited oppertunity. Because I was one of them. Even a smile or kind words could be helpful to someone.
