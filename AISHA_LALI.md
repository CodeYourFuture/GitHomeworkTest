Hello, my name is Aisha Athman Lali.
I really enjoy playing basketball. It's my favourite sport, mainly because my height works to my advantage when it comes to scoring goals.
When it comes to food, chicken is my all-time favourite. I love every dish that has chicken in it, whether it's baked, grilled, fried, or spiced up. Unfortunately, chicken is the most expensive meat in my country, so we tend to cook it only on special occasions. That's why chicken has a special place in my heart and stomach.

A fun fact about myself is that I truly enjoy spending time in the company of others.
