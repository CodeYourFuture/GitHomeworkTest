I am Melese Berehannu a trainee at Code Your Future Scotland Glasgow. I would like to play chess in my spare time so I would say chess is my favourite game why I would like chess because I can play with the computer at any time. My favourite food is "Doro Wette" cultural food in Ethiopia.Why it is my favourite because it is prepared in special ocassions like Easter after lent and served together with the familly in big round dish.
