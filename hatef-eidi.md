Hello to anyone is reading this introduction which is about me, Hatef Eidi.
My favourite sport is E-sport, also the traditional thinkers doubt it is an actual sport since it's only virtual. Anyway, E-sport is my favourite because it is so complplecated and noone can claim is the best in this field, and it changes with every update, not like other traditional sport which are being played in the same way for the last few millenia!!!
I think I like Iranian food the most, is it because of I'm Iranian? Well maybe, but Iranian food is not too spicy and not too blunt, just in between and balanced, and deliciouuuuus
