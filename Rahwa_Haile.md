Hello! My name is Rahwa Haile.

My favourite sport is football. I enjoy it because it brings people together, teaches teamwork, and keeps me active. The excitement of the game, especially during tournaments, is unmatched!

My favourite food is traditional Eritrean injera with tsebhi (spicy stew). I love it because it's both comforting and flavorful, and it reminds me of home and family meals.

Here's a link to a video of my favourite music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9tH-dJvuDE  
(This is a beautiful song by Sami Birhaneâ€”it reminds me of my home and brings back warm memories.)

An interesting fact about me: I never stop studying, even when I feel like I'm not making a big impact. My perseverance keeps me going because I believe growth takes time.

Nice to meet you!
