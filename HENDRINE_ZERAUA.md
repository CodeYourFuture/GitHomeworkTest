My name is Hendrine Zeraua and I like swimming because it targets all your muscles in the body and its a very gentle form of exercise.  My favourite food is rice dishes.  I like rice dishes because you can create a variety of recipes from it.

I once climbed the Kilimanjaro and reached the Stella Point, an altitude of 5,756 meters (18,885 feet) is one of three official summit points on Mount Kilimanjaro.
