Hello,

My name is Chioma Okeke, from Nigeria. My favourite sport is Football, although I am not good at playing but I quite enjoy being a spectator. I was attracted to football because of Ronaldinho, he was the best player in the world at a certain time. I like this sport because it is almost like a religion and you can easily strike up conversations with anyone globally because of this game.

I am not exactly sure that I have a favourite food, as I mostly eat depending on my mood. However, I know I eat in a very large quantity whenever I come across a well prepared pasta.

Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/EZ98IJ0usoE">link </a> to my favorite music

An fun fact about me is that I would have pursued a career as a Disc Jockey (DJ) or create beats for artists, had it been I was not delving into the tech industry.
