Hi, my name is Aly Elsharkawy.

My favorite sport is bodybuilding because it makes me feel good both physically and mentally. It helps clear my thoughts and keeps me focused and motivated.

When it comes to food, nothing beats roasted lamb for me. I love the rich taste, and it also gives me the strength I need to power through my workouts at the gym.

I love this track (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkH3aMIWntw). Listen to it, you might like it too

I love traveling! Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures is something Iâ€™m really passionate about.
