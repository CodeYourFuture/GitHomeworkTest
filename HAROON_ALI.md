Hi my name is Haroon Ali.

My favourite sport is badminton. I like it because I enjoy smacking around something that I can see wizzing past the net.

My favourite food is lasagne because it's an amazing combinaton of cheese and meat.

My favourite song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au2Ex0qElLE.

An interesting fact about myself is that I love JavaScript and want to conquer the world with it.
