Hello, my name is Senami Ahifon

I love swimming and I would love to swim in the ocean or do some scuba diving but I don't know how to swim, I would love to learn how to though.

Strangely, I do not have any favourite food, sorry!

I like Aretha Franklin and this is one of my favourite song of her:

I finished a 350 g of nutella in 2 hours and since then I can't stand chocolate much I doubt you will be impress by that!
