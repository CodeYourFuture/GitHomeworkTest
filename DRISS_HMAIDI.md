# Git Lesson Homework

Hello, my name is Driss Hmaidi.

My favourite sport is badminton, as it is fun and enjoyable as well as a good form of exercise.

My favourite food is pancakes as it is simply to prepare and very delicious.

My favourite music is classical music. Here is a link of my favourite song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VONMkKkdf4

An interesting fact about myself is that I lived in Germany for a year.
