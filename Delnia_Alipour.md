Hi,
I'm Delnia, I have a great passion for mountaineering; summiting a mountain would boost my mood significantly. I can feel the mountains by my heart and my soul. I also like high-speed cycling, it eases my stress and sameness.
My most favorite food is Ghorm-e-Sabzi. It's a very tasty Iranian food. 
Here is a link to one of number-one songs, Jacques Brel- Dans le port Amsterdam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3BSj1cHX-M
I have a sharp memory, especially in bringing back smell related events.
