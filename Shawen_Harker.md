Hi, my name is Shawen Aldred Harker and I live in the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town.

So I am a guy who loves many sports, bit of a sports funatic lol, but if I should choose one of them all, it would be soccer. This is the one game I can talk about all day. I'm a huge Liverpool FC fan. The reason why I love them so much is because of how they play, since a young age I always admired their style of play and how the fan go on when we win or lose a game. Soccer is a sport that bring nations together like no  other sport does and I honestly believe if we had to send one thing into space to represent earth, it would be soccer.

I'm a huge pizza and burger lover, I can't pick between the two but for the one reason I love pizzas is because it's a family meal and you can be extremely creative when topping a pizza, you are not stuck to a single form or style, its like a canvas to a painting, whatever you one to put onto it, thats what you do. Why I love burgers, is becuase its the most forgiving meal to make ever. You can put whatever you like onto a burger, as long as you follow a few basic rules, you cant go wrong and it is extremely filing.

My current favourite song currently now is Tom Walker - Lighthouse and the reason why I love it so is because the words is saying that he would never give up on his friend, the same way I feel about never giving up on the people I love and myself.

One interesting fact about is I was a naval cadet and wanted to join the airforce and become an airforce pilot. I'm an addreneline junky and love going the extra mile when it gets to taking responsible risk.

Thank you for reading about me.

Kind Regards
Shawen Aldred Harker
