My name is Delroy Gayle.

I grew up in the era of Muhammad Ali, so I guess my favourite sport is Boxing. Personally, I believe Mike Tyson was the last boxer of the 20th century who could claim to cause as much 'excitement' as Ali. So nowadays I believe the sport has become bland.

My favourite food is Chinese food since in my childhood it was the meal we had on Fridays; marking the end of the week and the beginning of the weekend. 
So I have grown up loving the taste of Chinese food.

Here is a sample of my favourite music:

An interesting fact about myself? Well I met the fastest man in the world! Usain Bolt. 
I guess I experienced what it means to be "starstruck"
I was shocked just how excited I was to meet him 
(However, that feeling was not mutual. LOL)
