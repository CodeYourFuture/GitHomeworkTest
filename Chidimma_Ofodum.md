My name is Chidimma Ofodum. 

My favorite sport is swimming because I am always excited when I am in a water body. I like to say that water is my favorite habitat. The only downside is that I cannot breathe while submersed.

I like trying out new food and incorportaing foreign flavors to my meals. My favorite food so far is the famous Turksih Piyaz served with vegetables; the most delicious meal I have ever had.

Regarding my favorite song, Afrobeats is my best as it always brings life to a party. My favorite artist is Burna Boy. The link to my favorite song from him is attached below.
