My name is ping wang. My favourite sport was to paly badminton but i have to say i did not paly too much when i was in China because i was too poor to go to the gym. Since i came to UK, running becomes my favourite sports specially after night shift as a nurse. I like most of Chinese food and dumpling is my favourite even though it does take time to make it.i like traditonal chinese music and of course enjoy listing music from my homedown which is called "huangmeixi"(https://youtube.com/shorts/rM8h5D0qzHg?si=t-oEMwLn8LmhU3N3). I have to say that i am a bit boring but my friends and colleagues know  that i am quite loud and noisy even i am fairly short!
