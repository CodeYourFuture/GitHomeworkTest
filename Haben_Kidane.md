Hello! My name is Haben Kidane, I was born in Eritrea.
My Favourite Sport is Football. I love football because it’s such an exhilarating sport! Its fast-paced nature and unpredictable outcomes keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The dramatic moments—like key plays, last-minute goals, and intense rivalries—create unforgettable memories that fans cherish and relive.
My Favourite Food is Injera. Injera is a sour, fermented pancake-like flatbread with a slightly spongy texture. It’s traditionally made with teff flour and pairs perfectly with flavorful stews, making it both comforting and delicious.
