My favorite sport

My favorite sport is Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) due to its captivating diversity. From the intricate ground grappling and submission techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to the explosive strikes and dynamic moves of Muay Thai, MMA offers an unparalleled range of skills. As a practitioner of BJJ, I find the strategic chess match on the ground mesmerizing, constantly learning and refining my techniques. Simultaneously, the adrenaline rush from Muay Thai's powerful kicks and punches fuels my enthusiasm for the sport. The seamless integration of various martial arts styles in the octagon, along with the mental resilience displayed by fighters, makes MMA a sport like no other, drawing me in not just as a fan, but as a way of life.

My favorite food

My favorite meal, deeply rooted in my Caribbean heritage, is Oxtail with rice and peas. This dish brings back cherished memories of my childhood, where my Nan would lovingly prepare it for me. The tender Oxtail, slow-cooked with aromatic spices, and flavorful rice and peas create a harmonious balance of tastes that embody the warmth and love of my Caribbean roots, making it more than just a mealâ€”it's a cherished connection to my identity and family traditions.

A fascinating fact about me is that I am a music producer specializing in Rap, Drill, and Hip Hop genres. Working with software like Fruity Loops, I have honed my skills to become quite proficient in its usage. What I find most exhilarating in my music production journey is incorporating old school samples and giving them a fresh twist. It's incredibly gratifying to recreate and re-imagine these classic elements into my tracks. Moreover, crafting creative and captivating basslines is another aspect that truly sparks my passion and adds depth to my music. As a music producer, I feel a sense of fulfillment in creating unique and innovative sounds that resonate with both myself and my audience.
