Hello everyone, my name is Simon Lawrence.

I'm not really into sports but if I had to pick one I would choose Baseball. I used to play Rounders when I was kid (a simple version of Baseball) and I was really good at hitting the ball out of the playground.

I really like food (as you can probably tell, lol) so it's hard to pick just one. I'm going to keep it simple and go with deep fried chicken. The reason why its my favorite food is because I never get tired of it, if i'm not careful I can eat it everyday.

My favorite song of all time is called Changes by Tupac Shakur. If you want to have a listen here is a link to it on YouTube. I must warn you that the song contains profanity, but it has a very deep message that I believe can improve the lives of those that hear it.

An interesting fact about me is that I am obsessed with space exploration. If I could afford a ticket on one of those billionaires fancy new rockets I would be there yesterday, lol.
