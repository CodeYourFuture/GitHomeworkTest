Hello!

My name is Patou Malongi Mabando, Trainee Web developer at CodeYourFuture ZA.

I love soccer because when I watch a live game or play soccer, I learn a lot about life.

"Success in life is never a constant linear path with an upward trajectory. You may feel like you're going backwards when you consciously try to move forward, but in reality, backwards is a natural progression of progress itself."

My favorite food is Fumbwa (Congolese food). It is easy to cook, smells good and is really tasty, and this is a link of my favorite music: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb_iRuhfdJA"

one more thing about me, I am the author of many songs that will be PUBLISHED ONE DAY. Strangely enough, I don't know how to play any musical instrument and I never wrote these songs intentionally. They are all spontaneous and I write them after having sung them spontaneously.
