My name is Maziar Mansouri.

My favourite sport is football. I would rather watch football than play football. I like football because it is very exciting.

My favourite food is 'Baghali Polow ba Mahiche' which is one of the most popular dishes in Iran and that is made from rice, fava beans, dill and lamb shank.

My favourite music: youtube.com/watch?v=9DLYjqF01O8

An intresting fact about me is I have two dates of birth and it happend because of issuer's fault and I didn't changed it :)
