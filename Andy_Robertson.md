# My introduction to codeYourFuture

My name is Andy Robertson and I enjoy following formula one, there is just something that is exciting about watching each team work together with the aim of it all coming together when it matters for that perfect drive.

I hate to be boring but my favourite food is the humble egg! Although high in cholesterol they are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals :-)

Being a lover of all types of music, if I had to narrow down my favourite music track of all time it would be [Coldplay Viva La Vida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZvsGmYKhcU/) as it is just the most amazing concert track. 

Hmm an interesting fact... I used to volunteer at the Scottish Railway Preservation Society and had the opportunity to drive a train once, *which was a thrilling but also very scary experience!*
