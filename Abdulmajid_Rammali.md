My favourite sport is cycling because when I am cycling I like to feel the wind and being outside.
My favourite food is anything with fish because there is many types of it, its a great source of protein and easy to digest.
I don't listen to music but here is my favorite peom

An interesting fact would be that I like to find ways to get the job done in the most energy saving way :D.
