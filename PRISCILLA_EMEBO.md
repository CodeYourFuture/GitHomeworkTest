My name is Priscilla. I am someone who finds happiness in little things and cherish life's moments.
I don't have a favourite sport and I don't actively participate in one, but I love activities like walking because it keeps me active. I also enjoy watching sports like swimming because their great talent facinates me.
My favourite food is Nigeria Jollof rice and I love it because of it's rich taste and flavour.
I enjoy listening to  "Worthy is your name Jesus by Brain and Jenn Johnson". The link to the music is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImYUxGm1vj4
One interesting fact about me is that I have a really nice handwritng. My notes were so neat and easy to read that I often received nice compliments from my classmates, who loved borrowing them.
