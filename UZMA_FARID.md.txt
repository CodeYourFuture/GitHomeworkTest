Hello, My name is Uzma and full name is Uzma Farid Khan.
I do not have any particular favourite sport but I like swimming race and game, In my opinion it is more fun,
 challengable, and intresting game.
My favourite food is our traditional non veg dish, we cook meat for upto 14 hours in mud pot and no spices in the dish,
 only salt, and no oil. it comes in rich flavour and real taste of dish. we call it "Karahi". Yummy 
There are so many songs and music which I personally love and listen to it over and over again. I like Arab
 Persian and English music. This is one of the song and the lyrics are, I hurt myself today to see if I can still feel.

 In my opinion every person is having an amzing and intresting facts, and make them different from each other.
 One of my intresting fact which I think is my eye colour, my eye colour is brown but in sunny day or bright day it turns
 to yellow and hazel. second, I did not learn drawing in my childhood or in school and college but I can sketch and draw 
 everything exactly same. People say it is natural talent and I should do more practice so I can be professional artist.
