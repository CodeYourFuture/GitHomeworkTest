hi,
I am siver omar ,from kurdstan of iraq. My favorite sport is skip rope.Although I am good at skipping rope I always do it as a part of my daily exercise.

biryani is one of my favorite food ,it is a mixed rice dish,which is eaten by most of the asian people.I like it because it traces me back to my old memories of home,family,and loved ones.

An fun fact about me is family,family is very important to me i have two siblings and I am very close to them.
