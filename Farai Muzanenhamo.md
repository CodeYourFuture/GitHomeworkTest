My name is Farai Muzanenhamo.
I like to play football because it involves strategy and at the same time good for the heart.
My favourite food is stewed chicken because of the flavours it has and the nutritious side of it.
Here is a link to my favourire music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk.
An interesting thing about me is that i can hold my breath for 4 minutes.
