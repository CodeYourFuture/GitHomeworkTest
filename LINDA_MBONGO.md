Hi My Name is Linda Mbongo, I am a huge fan of football and my favourite team locally is Kaizer chiefs beacuse it was my uncle's favourite and i happend to be so close to him and got influenced, on the other side I am also a Real Madrid fan.

When it comes to food I enjoy braai because I happend to be good at being a braai master since early day's at family's get together's.
