My name is Laleh Koupaei.

My favourit sport is jogging because I can get fresh air and boosts my mood.

My favourite food is any kind of kebab that barbecued by charcoal as I am a meat lover person.

My favourite song is Titanic and here is the link:

An intresting fact about me is that I used to paint with Pastels when I was about 25 , I will be so impressed when I travel to my country and see my pastel frames in my parents and family house.
