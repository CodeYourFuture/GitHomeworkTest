Hello, my name is Mandy. 

My favourite sport to watch would be rock climbing. I like seeing how different people decide how to climb a wall, some climbers are powerhouses who rely more on their strength and speed. I particularly enjoy watching the climbers who retain their energy, taking their time to figure out where to go next.

My favourite food is sushi, in particular - nigiri; fatty tuna, sweet shrimp, or salmon roe.

An interesting fact about me: When I was 17, I taught English to a class of children in a small village in Southwest China. The school was sponsored by the local cigarette company that handed out free boxes of cigarettes every week to the teachers.
