Hi my name is Najah. Im originally from Somalia but ive spent most of my adult life in the UK. Although im passionate about several sports
such as squash, swimming and running, football is my favourite. i was introduced to football as a young child and i loved the ease of just playing the game. 
There are no special equipment needed to play football and you can play with as little or as many people as you want. I also love the team aspect 
of the game,where to win the game everyone on the team as to collaborate and be on the same wavelength. Technically is also very hard to master. 
I dont really have a favourite food per say, it really just depends on my mood and what im craving that day. Sometimes i really like rasta pasta and other times 
id be craving biryani. I do like my food to have a lot of flavour and hint of spiciness. I dont really listen to music, so i dont have a link to music video
, however i do have a favourite video. This video is quran recitation by sh sudais with its meaning since im not a native arabic speaker. Some people might 
consider it to be similar to music because of the nature of the recitation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAjq4nXdfoQ.I can speak three languages fluently 
and can understand two whilst speaking a broken version.
