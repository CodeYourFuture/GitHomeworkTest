Interesting fact about me: I have a deathly hallows tattoo on my left shoulder, with a very personal meaning to me:
> Elder Wand for me means that I am capable of anything I set my mind to
> Resurrection Stone means that I am at peace with my past
> Cloak of invisibility for me symbolizes a bubble of protection from any harm
