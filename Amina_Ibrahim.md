My name is Amina Ibrahim. My favourite sport is swimming because it not only keeps me physically fit but also gives me a sense of calm and mental clarity; I enjoy the feeling of being in the water and how it challenges my body. When it comes to food, I love exploring diverse cuisines, but my absolute favourite is traditional Sudanese dishes, as they remind me of home and bring a deep sense of comfort and connection to my roots. For music, hereâ€™s a link to a video of one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lzCBNEgd4I (please adjust with your real favourite if needed!). An interesting fact about me is that I have completed a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences through the prestigious JSPS RONPAKU Dissertation PhD Program in Japan, reflecting my passion for research and commitment to advancing scientific knowledge across cultures and disciplines.
