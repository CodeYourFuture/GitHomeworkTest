My name is Elahe Mortazavi, you may call me Ellie.

My favorite sport is Water Skiing as you feel calm and forget about your daily worries. water skiing is just as relaxing and uplifting as meditation.

I love lots of different kinds of food. Iâ€™m not sure if I can pick one as my favorite, but kebab is at the top. why?! it's so delicious!

my favorite music: https://youtu.be/BueVGiyx_E4

programming is the third course I'm studying which is the most interesting one for me.
I love little turtles and I had one named Gigili!
