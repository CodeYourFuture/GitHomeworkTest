My name is Timea Reich. Timi for short.
I don't have a favourite sport, but I did rhythmic gymnastics, and ballet for 10 years. Maybe because I did it for so long and from such a young age (I was 3 when I started), I do not enjoy doing any kind of physical activity anymore.
My favourite food is sushi, I like everything about it, I like all Japanese food, I guess because they are kind of sweet, and I just love the harmony of the flavours. I would like to travel to Japan once and try sushi there.
Here is a link to one of my favourite songs, by THE BEST band in the world Linkin Park! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qF_qbaWt3Q
As for an interesting fact about myself, well I once walked into a crime scene. I was leaving for work at 4:30 in the morning, and as I opened the door and was about to take the rubbish out, someone started shouting at me, and well I found myself in the middle of a crime scene. I don't know how or why, but they did not tape our door with the police tape, so the investigator lady was yelling that I am ruining her crime scene. Looking back, I must have looked quite funny, standing there with the rubbish in hand, still half asleep, looking surprised, in the middle of a crime scene. I was late that day, because I missed my night bus.
