Hi there, my name is Riyaaz Singh
I'm from Cape Town, South Africa.

My favorite sport is freestyle Bmx'n or rather freestyle bicycle motor-cross/Racing as it is most commonly known.
The reason why I like it so much is because it's the only activity I did growing up that really stuck with me & that I thoroughly enjoyed until well into adolescence.

My favorite food is Lasagne & that's just because I think it tastes amazing lol.

A link to my favorite type of music found here:

An interesting fact about me, well i'm not sure how interesting it is lol but I am able to speak about quite a few topics in a conversation but not easily as I am generally very quiet.(that's all i can think of).
