## My name is Simeon.
I'm not a big fan of professional sports but sometimes I like to watch Football, because it's not just a game anymore, but a real mass show with an unpredictable scenario and its own superstars.
I don't like to cook but I definitely like pasta in Italian cuisine and how meat dishes are cooked in Turkish restaurants.
I listen to different music depending on my mood. Let it be something energetic and fun today:

When I was a kid I did martial arts like kickboxing and karate.`
