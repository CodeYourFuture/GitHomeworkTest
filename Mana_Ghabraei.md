My name is Mana
Some information about me is below
My favourite sport is swimming, I'm interested in this sport because I like water and It has fabulous profit.
Swimming is a good all-round activity because it: keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body. builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness.
I have a list of my favourite foods because I'm a trencherman person, but if I want just choose one of them I prefer "Gheymeh" that is a traditional food of my country.
