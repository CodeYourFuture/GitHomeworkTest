My name is Jasvir Kaur.
I do not take part in any sport on a regular basis due to other commitments but would love to play badminton. I really enjoy this sport. 
My favourite food is spinach and mustard curry cooked with spices. It is healthy and tasty. 
It is very hard to pick one particular music video as there is a lot out there. I will choose this one for this task. https://youtu.be/dSzFLZwEwF4
I wanted to be a scientist when I was in school.
