Hello, my name is Somayeh Karimi!

My favorite sport is mountaineering, I think it exciting. I have not gone to the mountain from a year ago when I have moved to london.

My favorite food is English Breakfast - Generally I like breakfast!

One of my favorite tracks is  Send My Love -Adele !

My interesting fact is that I love jumping and I like to camping where I can jumping in the river or lake despite I am not good at swimming!

Thanks for reading!
