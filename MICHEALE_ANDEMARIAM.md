Hey, my name is *Micheale Andemariam*. I love all kinds of sports, but my favourite sport is football because I grew up watching and playing football with my friends since childhood. When it comes to food, I like foods that make me feel good and active after eating them, such as brown rice with chicken, fish and rice and pasta spaghetti.

Here is a link to a video of my favourite music. It is called New Beginning by *Tracy Chapman*.
