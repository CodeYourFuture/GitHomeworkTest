About me

My name is Lorena Capraru. I am a student in the last year for a Bsc diploma in Computing. I have no favorite sport, although I try to make the right decisions regarding a healthier life style.
Regarding food, I am definitely a gourmand as I love italian cuisine along with chinese, romanian, spanish and mexican.
My favorite song is Love on the Brain- Rihanna. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMP-o8WXSPM
Interesting fact about myself is that now I get to accomplish all the things I have started prior in my life without finishing them, hence I find myself only in educational environments nowadays like driving school, college, bootcamp, even gym classes sometimes, homework with my kid.
