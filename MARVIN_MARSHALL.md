Hi, my name is Marvin-Lee Marshall.

I am 30 years young and a father to my beautiful babies.

My current profession is a Customer Facing Social Media Ambassador. 
I work for a crypto tech start-up named LUNO. I've been working with Luno for 2 years 
and I've been in the industry of Customer Experience for atleast 8 years now.
I can only be so grateful that I have been able to find what I believe is my passion and that is Software Development.
I would love to venture into the tech industry to show my children that anything is possible and also to 
live a life more fulfilling with passions that matter and that is solving the worlds problems with technology.

To be fair, I am not really into any sport, but lets consider athletics a sport.
I really love track events, namely the 100 meter, 200 meter, 400 meter and relay events.
I was never really good at any sport growing up but I was really fast and I was recruited by a coach for the Metropolitan running club.
From that point on, I ran at every event I could find. I have both WP colors and S.A colors. I've never stopped loving the track and 
I do for the occasional run.

My favorite food by far is a healthy plate of Mac and cheese! I would die for Mac and cheese! Rob a bank for Mac and cheese! I would even sell my
laptop for Mac and cheese.

I was in pre-primary when I had it for the first time. Teacher April was the one who made lunch. She made us Mac and cheese and I will never forget the day.
The cheese was slightly burnt which gave the effect of an almost crispy melted cheese. The sauce was like no sauce could ever be. 
Think creamy, fluffy, not too thick, not too thin, just the perfect consistency. She added chicken one day.
Softly cooked, not dry or bland. Just perfect, Shame, I wonder where in this world she is hey. I remember seeing her in grade 2 on the escalator in Woolies
as mom and I left to catch a bus out of town. She was so amazed at how big I've grown. God bless her soul for giving me a memory I will forever live with.

I AM A WALKING MUSIC LIBRARY AND I LISTEN TO SO MANY DIFFERENT GENRES ALL THE TIME!!!!
But here's a link to what I have on repeat most of the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa1IaUywiO8
The song is by an artist called Tems called higher and its a live rendition.
I really love how the melodic structuring and architecture of the rendition comes together also she has really good live vocals!!

An interesting fact about me is that I was raised in church most of my life and I can now play 5 different musical instruments. Recorder, Violin, Trumpet, Clarinet &Double bass.

Thank you for reading!
