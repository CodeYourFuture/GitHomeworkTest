Hi, My name is Jihad and you are welcome here, My favorite sport is football because it has a lot of energy
and the competition level is so high. My preferred food is Asian cuisine since it is very tasty and full of fabulous flavors.
 
My favorite music is Sudanese song for Mahmoud Abdulaziz : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWqlUZxLGbY
 
An interesting fact about me is that I do not like watching movies but sometimes I enjoy studying.
