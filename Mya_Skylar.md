Hi my name is Mya Skylar.
I don't have any particular favourite Sport as I'm not a sporty person. But sometimes I do play bowling and i found it really fun :)
My favourite food is Malaysian Chicken Rice. Fragrant rice cooked with chicken stock, serve with roasted soy chicken and sweet chili sauce.
One of my favourite song is ['Back to Black' by Amy Winehouse.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_25S5BgTlg) What a emotional lyrics!
