My favorite sport is football. I used to play football a lot when I was a kid. My friends and I played together for whole days, and since then, I have loved football so much.
My favorite food is lasagna. I love it so much, especially the beef one with mushrooms and onions. My mother has cooked it for my family, and since then, I have loved it even more.
