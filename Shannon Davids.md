Hi mane is Shannon Davids an im an aspiring developer.
My favourite sport is Football and im a huge Liverpool FC supporter.I love football because of the strategy,work rate and sheer heart pounding anticipation you get from never knowing how a match is going to end but always cheering your team on.
My favourite food is any and all home cooked meals. I just find comfort in how the smell fulls out the house letting you know your home.
