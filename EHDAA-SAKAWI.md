My name is Ehdaa Munier sakawi 
My favourite sport is fitness because it raises my self esteem mentaly and physically and I just feel better about my day and about myself when I workout. 
Also to look and feel great, and stay healthy as I get older.
My favourite food is Mahashi, It is a Syrian dish, it is vegetables such as Zucchini, Pappers and Eggplant, inside theses vegetables there are rice, meat
and mixed spices. The reaseon why it is my favorite becase my mom used to cook it for us, and when I eat it, I go back to my best memories with my mom.
My favourite music is Romantic like https://youtu.be/mHONNcZbwDY .
The interesting fact about me is I was a vegetarian 5 years ago but now I am not.
