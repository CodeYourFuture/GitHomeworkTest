Gayle Ngozi: An Introduction:-

Hello there. My name is Gayle Ngozi THompson-Igwebike. 
People call me Gayle OR Ngozi, as I have diverse interests and do many diferrent things in my life, so dependending on where you know me from, you may call me one or the oter. 
For example, I am an 'igbo' from Nigeria and many nigerians call me Ngozi as that is my 'IGBO'name and I personally prefer it, but in school, they called me Gayle. I dont mind either. They were lovingly thought of by my parents and my names are testatment to how much thought they put into naming me. Ngozi means 'God's blessings' and Gayle means a 'strong woman'. So you can now see why I hold onto all my names.

My favourite sport: 
I don't like sports. I am far too lazy for sports and I dont particularly find them interesting topics to discuss-though I like womens football a little- but I am happy to watch international or worldwide competetitions, probably because i'm cheering with others and enjoy the sense of camaraderie and connection that it brings to people. Other than that, Sorry CYF, I can't win you any medals at any upcoming sports events...

My Favourite Food:
My favourite food is a called 'ABACHA'. Abacha is local delicacy in igboland in nigeria, made from cassava flakes, eggplants, local bean paste, fish and other local ingredients. It has gained some international fame actually and is often referd to as 'African salad' by other countries. 

Why it is my favourite food:
Abacha is my favourite food because it tastes amazing, is healthy as it is made with fresh local ingredients and of course, it is very rare or scarce to find in this country. It also reminds me of home and my parents,especially my mum who loved almost as much as I did.

Favourite Music/Song: I like many many songs and it is never easy to choose one in particular, however:
Here is a link to a video of one of my favourite music/songs:

The reason this song is my favourite is because I have found it very encouraging through out my life especially at times like this, when I just started something totally new, like this CYF SD course.

An interesting fact about myself...? 
Hmmm...I used to have a very crippling shyness. It was so bad I had to be taken to the doctors for help. I have learned and practiced ways to overcome a lot and now, you cannot stop talking...(Dont laugh!)

I hope this has helped you to know me a little better. Cheers
