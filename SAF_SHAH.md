My name is Saf shah. I enjoy watching competitive cricket.
Cricket involves both teams strategically outsmarting each other. Apples are my favorite food, they are good for your health.
I'm into instrumental music at the moment, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSqXM0MeVsI enjoy.
I've walked on 5 meters of burning hot coals. It was to raise my awareness of how powerful my mind is, mind over matter.
