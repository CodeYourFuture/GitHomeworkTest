Walter Tanaka Chifamba I love swimming because of it slows down the effect of aging who doesn't want to be young forever.My favourite food is Cottage Pie.I love cheese, potatoes and mince and it has all of that.I am a barista i have been in the hospitality industry for 6 years and I plan in future to open a tech company which deals with Point Of Sale systems.Im a founder of a clothing brand called Native Element ZA.I have realised that im becoming a tech junkie so i do attend my addiction meetings everyday its either im googling, github, stackoverflow and my favourite is every Saturday at <h1>Code Your Future</h1>. When it comes to music i do not have a genre as i listen to anything depending on the mood.Roots Reggae everyday as they say it music for the mature ears.
