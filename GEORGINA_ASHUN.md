   My name is Georgina Esi Ashun.

   I like running because it is a healthy exercise that leaves me feeling refreshed. My longest run has been a 10k run. I guess I need a higher running challenge!

   I love Jollof rice because it is the best food in the whole world and has been able to start a war between Nigeria and Ghana. By the way, Ghana Jollof is the best!

   Here's a link to the video of my favourite song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vv-BfVoq4g

   In my early teens I composed my own code language to use for my diary which I still remember. Do guess what this says - .wd7388.^e, nun?
