Hi, my name is Gelson Celestino!

My favorite sport is hiking (Not sure if hiking is a sport), I enjoy hiking because of the feeling you get once you are on top of the moutains. 

My favorite food is Lasagne - Love the melted cheese when it comes out of the oven.

One of my favorite tracks is You Mean Everything To Me by Jenn Johnson

My interesting fact is that I can four different instruments: Drums, Piano, Acoustic Guitar and Bass Guitar.

Thank you for reading
