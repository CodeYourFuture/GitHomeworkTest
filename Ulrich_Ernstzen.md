 Hi, my name is Ulrich Ernstzen.

 I dont actually have a favorite sport but if I had to choose one I would go with soccer.

 My favorite food is Pasta, I dont know how to make it but i stand ready if they had to dish me a bowl.

 One of may Favorite tracks is Tragic of The Kid Laroi.

 I consider myself to be a troubleshooting geek, I like solving problems and make sure I understand completely what I learned and how does it work, so that I am able to explain it to the next person what I have learned and how it works.
