# Waleed Sannoufeh

Hi, I'm Waleed. I'm not really a sporty kind of person, but I really like playing Table Tennis. This is because I used to play it a lot when I was young.

My favourite food has to be rice pudding. It's absolutely delicious and there's not much else to say!

An interesting fact about me is that I can play the piano.
