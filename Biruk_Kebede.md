Hi, my name is Biruk Kebede.

Although I do not currently run, my favourite sport is running because it helps me to focus on the present moment.

My favourite food is salmon fish because it is healthy and easy to cook.

My favourite music : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8

An interesting fact about me is that I enjoy writing poetry, mainly in my first language which is Amharic.
