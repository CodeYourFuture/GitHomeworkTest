Hi, my name is Natalie Zablotska!

Italian food is my favorite one, especially Neapolitan pizza🍕.

I love this song of Tom Odell - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwpMEbgC7DA. He is fundraising money to Ukrainians, by the way 💙💛.

I am not a big fan of sport, but cycling 🚴 and swimming 🏊‍♂️ are fun!

My interesting fact is that I can make delicious sushi rolls at home🍣.

Thanks for reading!
