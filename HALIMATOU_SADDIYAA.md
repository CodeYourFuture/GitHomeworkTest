My name is Halimatou Saddiyaa.
My favourite sport is fast walking. I can practice it anytime and everywhere and it keeps me in shape. I like watching birds and squirrels while i'm fast walking in my local park.
My favourite food is Hummus. I find it quite tasty for such a simple recipe. It is also very nutritious. I like the fusion of chickpeas, tahini and olive oil.
