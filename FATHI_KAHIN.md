# About Me

Hello, I'm Fathi. Sports has never been my cup of tea, and that remains true to this day. so, I don't really have much to say about sports. But let me tell you about something I really like - Bariis. It's my favorite food, and what's cool about Bariis is that it's not just yummy; it's also a healthy choice with fewer calories than biriyani.

I've got this music that I really enjoy. It is a type of oud lute (kaban). You can check it out here ðŸ‘‰ https://youtu.be/wxbh6a3o8bA?si=HDgxfOuMp2RvSJs1

Now, here's something interesting about me: I've been walking to work for three hours a day for over 20 years. That's a lot of walking, right? But here's the cool part - during all that time, I've managed to listen to 1,141 books. Yep, I love learning and improving myself, and I find it super interesting to listen to audiobooks while I walk.
