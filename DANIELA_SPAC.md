My favourite food is pizza because I like cooking and use lots of ingridients, such as meat, vegetables and cheese.

I have a lot of hobbies, such as painting, sewing, photography, pets, rock music, hand-made, dancing and I spend most of my time at my laptop, mostly like working in PhotoShop editing photos and editing short videos. I like to travel!
