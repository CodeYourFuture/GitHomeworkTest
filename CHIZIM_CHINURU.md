Hello. My name is Chizim Chinuru
I really do not have a favorite sports unfortunately but I watch wrestling a lot. I guess I would have to call it my favorite sports
My favorite food is Beef Lasagne and that is because I can not go wrong cooking it
Here is a link to my favorite music for the year https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0RGyzUFbko 
One interesting fact about me is that I am a chef and I am very good at my job as a chef. And I don't like chocolate. It should never have been discovered :)
