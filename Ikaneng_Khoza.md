My name is Ika. 
I like walking and watching F1 with my husband and son. After years of pretending to be interested for their sakes, I can safely say I'm a fan.
Beef Stew cooked outside on fire using a three-leg big black pot. It is a favourite because most women in the village cook this with such love and passion including a bit of singing.

I'm not sure if I can impress you but I'm a hopeful romantic. I find love stories interesting. Two people doing life as one is fascinating to me.
