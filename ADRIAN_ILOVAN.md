Hello, my name is Adrian and I'm a part-time driver, when I have time I enjoy going to the gym to lift weights I enjoy this because it feels like an escape from the normal.
My favorite food is literally any type of pasta, best time in my life was when I lived in Italy for a while.
At the moment this is my favorite song but this can change quick because I listen to a lot of music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1rgr6rumn8
Not sure what someone would say it's interesting about them, if I have to say something I'm ambitious but that's not interesting.
Thank you :)
