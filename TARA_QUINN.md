My name is Tara. I guess my favourite sport is football, which I like for the sense of community and its working class roots. My dad played gaelic football when I was growing up, so I still love watching that, however I have less opportunity to do so.

I like most food, to be honest! I cook a lot and have been lucky to work with some amazing chefs and be exposed to food from all around the world. I love the commonality of it: pretty much every culture has some kind of stuffed pastry, right? 

My current favourite is this new collaboration between Angel Olsen and Sharon Van Etten. It's epic! https://youtu.be/5ibj87fwRaM

I was a champion Irish dancer when I was young, as unlikely as that might sound.
