Hi,
My name is Musa,
I like cycling because during to cycling I am feeling free and more energetic. I can watch nature, there is no sound like a car or engine.

My favorite food is Fish, I like almost every fish with a special salad.

My favorite music is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bglg8rlrTo8 because The main idea of this song is 'love' and 'people can change...'

My interesting facts are that once upon a time I was an instructor Pilot in the Turkish Air Force, but I am an asylum seeker now... Life is very changeable, isn't it?
That's me :) 
Thank you...
