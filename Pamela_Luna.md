Hello, my name is Pamela, but you can call me Pam :)
My favourite sport is swimming I love to swim, especially in open water, my birthday is in summer and cannot enjoy being in the water swimming with friends and family. 
My favourite food is Paella Spanish seafood, I enjoy all types of seafood it's fresh and super tasty with a good red wine of course! I cooked myself but I like to taste other food, maybe I should plan to go to a tv show Come dine with me....🤔
my favourite song, this song remembers me of the first time Spain won the world cup I was in Madrid and we celebrate it. 🍾🎊
