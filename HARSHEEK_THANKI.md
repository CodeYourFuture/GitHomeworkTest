Hi there,

I'm Harsheek Thanki.

My favourite sport is swimming. I love being in the water!

My favourite food is mexican because it always fills me up :)

Heres a link to a video of my favourite music:

And finally an interesting fact about me - I used to play bass guitar in music bands when I was younger.
