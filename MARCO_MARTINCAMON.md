My name is Marco Martin Camon

I have never really loved sports but if I had to choose one it would be basketball. My father played in his local team when he was young and it´s much quicker and more dynamic than football.

Regarding my favourite food I keep it simple. Two fried eggs, not runny nor burnt on the edges, with french fries, homemade if possible, but thin and crispy in any case. Add enough bread on the side.

Regarding my favourite music that is obviously a difficult one. I have many different "favourite musics" depending on the day and my mood, but this one represents very well the feeling that made me make the jump from hospitality and office jobs to study software development. Mind you, it´s a bit explicit, ignore the link if you are bothered by the "F" word :)

Fun fact: When I was born, a friend of my parents whose job was to make gravestones, made one for me as a joke. I still have it and intend to use it when the time comes. Also, it has a carved message that rhymes.
