My name is Berenice
My favourite sport changed from cricket to soccer and the reason is that before I met my hubby, I did not understand the game of soccer, so now I watch and enjoy it even more than he does...except when Liverpool is playing, then I stress, because I don't want them to lose, off course
My favourite food also changed from being pizza to a Nigerian dish called Egusi. It is made from grinded watermelon seeds and tastes absolutely divine.

I love travelling and had been blessed to visit a few countries. I've had the opportunity to travel to across five countries on the African continent during and overland tour with exchange students in 2004. In the same year I ravelled to the USA wth a church group and I did not want to come back home and cried because my visa had expired and I obviously did not want to be deported. Then in February of 2005 I traveled to Swaziland. Two trips I undertook to Germany was work related and I absolutely loved Berlin. Since then I've also been to Scotland to visit church family and close friends. Nigeria (my hubby's place of birth) is on my bucket list, and I pray I'm able to travel there soon in the nearby future.
