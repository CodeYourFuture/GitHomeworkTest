My name is Bradley Mubenga, I love rugby because it is a very rough and physical sport. 

My favourate food is grilled ribs and cheddar cheese, I love this meal because the cheese gives the beef an amazing flavour.

An interesting fact about me is that I have eaten a full gasby sliced in four pieces and I had a 2 litre Jive to wash it down.
