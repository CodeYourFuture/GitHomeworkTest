my name is Tsione Temesgen Abraham
My favorite sport is Tennis. I love this sport because it helps to focus and improves how I manage obstacles.
My favorite food steamed vegetable salad with chicken. I love this dish because it's healthy and tasty as well.
I love this music video by Tye Tribbett and I hope you will love it too. (click the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcJan_XXM1Y)
Interesting fact about me: people have always found my scream very weird and funny. I have a weird scream when I am in pain that usually makes people laugh instead of helping me out. I have tried to learn how to properly scream or shout like a lady but it was in vain.
