# My Introduction
My name is Adiyah Farhan. My Favourite sport is Badminton. I am fond of it because of my personal interest in this sport since childhood. I got many chances to play this game in childhood and this was the reason that I got personally attached with this game.

My Favourite food is Biryani. This is the one of the famous Pakistani food. I like it becuase of it's overwhelming taste and also it's very easy to cook and serve.
