# Jude here!

## Sport

I love both tennis and cricket for different reasons.

### tennis

Although I have not played tennis for a while my plan is to get back to it as I think it important for focusing the mind, meeting likeminded people and getting fit ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Cricket

With cricket on the other hand, I am a peripheral spectator, meaning, I like to be in the vicinity of the game on a family day out, but I am not necessarily watching unless something dramatic has happened. The drama is usually indicated by the noise of the crowd, so even if you are in the clubhouse you know it time to pay attention, applaud, then go back to what you were doing!. Many childhood memories were made going to Wadham Lodge in Walthamstow.

## Food

I am a vegetarian, and have been since the age of 17. I like all sorts of food for West African, Thai, Jeanene and Chinese and have adapted traditional Jamaican dishes for my pallet

## Interesting fact

I am an artist, until recently this was not a label I was willing to accept.  
I mix storytelling from archival data, interactivity and programming ‚Äì an awesome combo üòä
I do some public speaking on issues around my practice and social change, my hope to get better at engaging audiences in this way.
