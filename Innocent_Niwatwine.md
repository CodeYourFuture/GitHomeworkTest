I am called Innocent Niwatwine from uganda ,a young and ambitious man who works tirelessly to change the conditions back home,I am a business Administration graduate from Makerere University.I come from a humble family background and i have 5 siblings ,i am a third born.
I am a student of life and a believer.
I like football as a sport and a fan especially europe football, I support Manchester United as football club.I like football because it unites me with people especailly when we are in video halls watching the games,it brings a sense of togetherness.
I grow up liking Rice as the best meal because it was cooked on only special days like christmass so whenever i am taking it ,it reminds me of childhood good days.
