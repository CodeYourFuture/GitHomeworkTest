#### Hello! My name is Sumayeh Nasser, and Iâ€™m currently a trainee with CodeYourFuture. ####



<b>My favourite sport is brisk walking.</b> I enjoy it because it helps me stay active, clear my mind, and explore the world around me without needing any special equipmentâ€”just a good pair of shoes!



When it comes to food, I absolutely love <b>pizza</b>. Itâ€™s my favourite because itâ€™s so versatileâ€”you can enjoy it with endless combinations of toppings, and itâ€™s perfect for sharing with friends and family.



Hereâ€™s a link to a video of my favourite music:

An interesting fact about me: <b>I love solving puzzles!</b> Whether itâ€™s a tricky riddle or a coding challenge, I enjoy finding creative solutions and stretching my problem-solving skills. Itâ€™s one of the reasons I was drawn to tech!
