My name is Kimberly. I prefer Kimberly and not Kim.
I am not really into sports, but if I had to choose one, I would say basketball or ice skating, because I enjoyed doing both of them when I was young.
My love Ethiopian food because it's so rich - you enjoy eating it as well as the experience you share with others.
I love Celine Dion:

I am deaf in my right ear.
