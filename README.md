# Git Lesson Homework

To complete this homework you should

1. Fork this repository to create version on your profile
2. Clone the new repository from your profile using Github Desktop
3. Create a new file called `FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.md`
   - For example, if your name is Joe Smith then call your file `JOE_SMITH.md`
4. In this file, write an introduction yourself. You should include:


   1. Your name : 
      Donna Henry
   2. Your favourite sport and why you like it:
      Badminton: Lots of laughs with friends and getting bit of exercise too. Unfortunately not played for a couple of years. 
   3. Your favourite food and why it's your favourite: 
      Anything fresh and homemade. Recently enjoyed Kissir and tried a masala dosa for the first time. Tres bien! 
   4. A link to a video of your favourite music

      A long time favourite from Joni Mitchell but quite a boring video!

      Alternatively, this is an incredible song and an amazing video by Childish Gambino

   5. An interesting fact about yourself - impress us!

      I once hitchhiked for charity from UK to Tangier in Morocco and was jammy enough to complete this in one lift.
5. `Commit` the file to your repository
6. `Push` the file to Github
7. Open a `Pull Request` to this repository

## Finished Work

When you've finished you should have a `pull request` that looks like this

## Asking for Help

Have you had problems with any of the steps above. Ask for help on Slack - another student or a teacher will be able to help you!

When you ask for help you should always say what exactly isn't work

**Do not write:** "Git doesn't work. Can someone help me?"

**Do write:** "I've tried to push my file using git but it's giving me this error XYZ. I've tried to search Google for the answer but I can't find anything. Can somebody help me?"
