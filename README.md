introduction about my self.
   1. Muath Alawadhi
   2. Football is my favorite sport. The reason I like football so much is that I enjoy playing it and it is as good for the body as exercise. 

   3. Rice and chicken are my favorite foods. Honestly, I don't know why it is my favorite, but I think it's because I have eaten rice and chicken since I was a child. Also, in my country, it is a traditional dish .
