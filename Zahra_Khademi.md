I'm Zahra.
My favorite sport is climbing and I like it because climbing is not just about physical strength; it also involves problem-solving and decision-making. 
My favorite food is Casarecce, which is an Italian pasta and it is very delicious.

I'm fluent in three languages, including Italian, which I learned during three years of living in Bologna.
