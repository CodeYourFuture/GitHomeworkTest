My name is Askin Ekinci.

My favourite sport is squash because it is an intense sport that I work out all the muscles of my body and I can burn more calories in just 30 minutes than in any other sport.

Kebab is my favourite food because it is not only healthy but so delicious as well. I can't stand eating beyti which is a sort of popular kebab. ðŸ¤¤

I have a couple of favourite songs. These are Zombie from Cranberries, Rockabye from Anne-Marie, Nothing Else Matters from Metallica.

An interesting fact about myself is that I am the only person in my family who is living abroad.
