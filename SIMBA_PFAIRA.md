My name is Simba Pfaira

My favourite sport is volleyball. I like it because I am good at it and you can play it almost anywhere, be it a sports field, the beach, in a pool e.t.c

My favourite food is chicken strips. I like them because they have a great taste, and they are easy to make by myself.

My favourite music video -Sia - The greatest! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKSRyLdjsPA

The most interesting fact about me is that I have good sense of humour
