Hello, my name is Fatih. My favaourite sport is orienteering. Orienteering is a sport that competitors try to find hidden targets 
by using a detailed map and compass in a certain terrain. I like this sport as I like the nature. 
My favourite food is pizza. Not so healty but still likes it :)
My favourite music is Cheap Thrills by Sia. You can open it via this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31crA53Dgu0 
An interesting fact about myself is I didn`t know how to swim in my first year in high school. After one year of training, I become a member of 
High School`s swimming team.
