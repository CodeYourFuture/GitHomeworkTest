Hello, my name is **Temwa Nyirenda** and I am part of the South Africa Class 2 CYF Cohort.

So a little bit about myself:

- My favourite sport is **squash**, it's something of a family sport that I've been playing since I was young (though I'm not that good)
- My favourite food has got to be **pizza**. There's so many possibilities of the type of pizza that you can't go wrong with it.
- My song obsession currently is Amen by Amber Heard, the ending is gorgeous. **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEHzoTDmlSs&list=PLGDs0bHCiNzufiyLhpEmQUIbBV9BszRMl&index=26**
- Something interesting about me I have watched every. single. episode. of Grey's Anatomy. I love that show.
