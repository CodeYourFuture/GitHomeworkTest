Hello Everyone, I am always interested in sports but among them i like volleyball the most where we get chance to play in team.I am a person who always likes to work within a team where we can share our ideas, views and also learn. I love to try different variety of foods and love to make as well. there are lots of food to choose but i would like to take a name "Mo-Mo" which is famous Nepalese Food. Its like a dumpling food which we can steam and eat with tomato pickle.
I love all types of music but i enjoy listening soothing music when i am alone. My favorite music video
