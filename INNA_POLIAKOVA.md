Hi guys!

My name is Inna Poliakova.

I like sport a lot, especially I love running. While running, I enjoy overcoming laziness and my thoughts are refreshed.

I prefer traditional Ukrainian dishes such as borsch. This is delicious!

My favourite music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bvesW1inKQ

Do you remember that I like running? 3 years ago I ran the Athens Marathon 2019 (42 km). By the way, I plan to repeat this expirience next year.

Thanks for reading and I am looking forward to getting your comments.
