My name is Ahmad Janah.
I like all kinds of sport, but my favourite one is football because it is a team game, and all team members should collaborate together to succeed.
MY favourite food is kubba. It is a very delicious Arabic traditional food. I like it because only mums can do it as it should be.
favourite music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5ByqlAtg48
Interesting fact: that there is no interesting fact.
