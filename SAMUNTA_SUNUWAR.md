Hi, my name is Samunta Sunuwar. 
I like esports more than physical sports as I play egames and find the esport relatable. My favourite game at the moment is Clash Royale because it's quite strategic and engaging.
My favourite food is Pizza Margherita because I feel like this is my comfort and go to food when I don't know what else to go for.
My favourite song is Somewhere Over the Rainbow covered by Nora Jones. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9xbMsxHZR4
An interesting fact about myself - I was born prematurely at 7 months. In my country it is believed People born in at 7 months are generally lucky in life ;)
