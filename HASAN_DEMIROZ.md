Hi, my name is Hasan Demiroz!

My facourite sport is camping and motorcycling. Because I like nature and freedom. I find them relaxing.

My favorite food is barbecue because of its smoky flavors, delicious variety, and the joy it brings to gatherings.

I love spending time in my kitchen, where I enjoy baking delicious cakes and cooking flavorful dishes from scratch.
