My Name is Mame Mbaye, I am a trainee at CYF West Midland
My favorite sport is football and the reason i like is because it has been a passion since childhood.
My favorite food is Mafe and it's a senegalese famous dish made with peanut butter which is the reason why i like.
Here's a link to a video of my favorite song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9VQye6P8k0. 
An interesting fact about myself is that i speak 4 foreign languages(hope that it is interesting :)
