    It's impossible to name a single dish.  However, I've recently have gone mad over stuffed squid.  So, for this reason I'm going to go with stuffed squid.  It comes fried, baked or grilled. You're spoiled for choice. Just this alone makes it a favourite.  And it's also more sustainable and healthier than meat.

    Here is an unusual short story about how I got into coding. As a manager of a restaurant, I always enjoyed being on the floor more than in the back office. I would often attend tables taking orders when I felt the team could use an extra pair of hands during lunch or dinner rush. I was taking an order once, the guest looked at my notepad with confusion and asked if I had the correct order. I repeated the order back and then headed over to the computer to punch it in. He kindly apologized for been doubtful, mentioning what I had written down looked nothing like what he ordered. I had written the entire order in shorthand like always. On his way out he advised me to look into programming, suggesting that I would enjoy it. Little did he know that it's exactly what I did.
