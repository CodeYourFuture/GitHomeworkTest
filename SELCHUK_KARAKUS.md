5. An interesting fact about yourself - impress us!
    Here is an unusual short story about how I got into coding. As a manager of a restaurant, I always enjoyed being on the floor more than in the back office. I would often attend tables taking orders when I felt the team could use an extra pair of hands during lunch or dinner rush. I was taking an order once, the guest looked at my notepad with confusion and asked if I had the correct order. I repeated the order back and then headed over to the computer to punch it in. He kindly apologized for been doubtful, mentioning what I had written down looked nothing like what he ordered. I had written the entire order in shorthand like always. On his way out he advised me to look into programming, suggesting that I would enjoy it. Little did he know that it's exactly what I did.
