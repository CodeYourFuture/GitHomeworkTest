Hi, My name is Mansoor Munawar and my favourite sport is jogging because it is something you can do at anytime and dont require any equipment apart from a good pair of running shoes. My favourite food is pasta/spaghetti with chicken and vegetables because its taste delicious when made right and it is also healthy. My favourite music video comes from an anime called Your Name - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pHfPJGatgE&ab_channel=Tranquility. I am big fan of Star wars and seen every movie at least 2-3 times. 5. An interesting.
