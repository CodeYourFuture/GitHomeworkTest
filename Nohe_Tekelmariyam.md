HI,my name is Nohe Tekelmariyam, i would like to you share a little  about my self and favorite things .
I have a deep passion for sports, and my favorites is football a. 
football are  very  popular sports, i like football since i was kid, the reason i love this sport  It's a team sport that teaches cooperation and strategy, which I find fascinating and i made a lot of friends 
When it comes to food, nothing beats the satisfaction of a delicious plate of Doro Wet. Doro Wet is an Ethiopian stew made with chicken, spices, and injera (a sourdough flatbread). The reason why it's my favorite is because of the rich, complex flavors that burst in every bite. 
my favourite music is by Ed Sheeran https://youtu.be/JGwWNGJdvx8?si=uzo0lHUriyQ6hh0_
patience is a super important thing to achieving my goals. It's like taking a long journey, and even though i can't see the finish line right away, i keep on going, step by step. When I set a goal for myself, I don't give up easily, even if things get tough. I believe that with time and effort, I can make my dreams come true. This patience helps me stay focused and not get discouraged when things don't happen right away. I think it's a quality that can inspire others because it shows that I'm willing to work hard and wait for the right moment to succeed.
