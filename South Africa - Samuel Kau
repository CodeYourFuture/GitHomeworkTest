Good afternoon, 
I am Samuel Kau, my favourite sport is soccer, I love the techniques, the ball handling skills and the atmosphere at matches.
When it comes to favourite food, I have a few. I love anything with cheese in it, like pizza, pastas etc. I love ribs and chips. I live chinese noodles or hot curries. I love the various tastes and flavours
My favourite music video is from Camila Cabello https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp_P_e1cPOE&list=RDAMVMFp_P_e1cPOE

Interesting fact: I don't really have a favourite hobby, I love doing a variety of things at any given time.
