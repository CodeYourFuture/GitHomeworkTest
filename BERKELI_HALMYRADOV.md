My Name is Berkeli
My favourite sport is Weightlifting because it allows to test the limits of your body and there's no other feeling like the adrenaline from lifting more than double of your weight. 
My favourity food is Plov because it's relatively easy to cook and delicious.

When I was 16 I competed in National olympics of Turkmenistan in Information Technology and got 2nd place, to this date I am the only person from my school to compete and place in top 3 in National olympics in any subject.
