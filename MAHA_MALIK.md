Hi my name is Maha Malik.
Favourite sport is Badminton - I love the feeling of swishing the shuttlecock with my racket. It's great exercise, not overly intensive, and is so much FUN!
Chicken Manchurian is one of my favourite foods, it's the perfect chicken and rice dish, absolutely divine!
Favourite song: 'Chura liya hai' ... An old bollywood classic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R7Po4Wpbj8
Interesting fact about me: I love sleeping, would win a sleeping marathon any day, hands down. Must've been a cat in a previous life.
