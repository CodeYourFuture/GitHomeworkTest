Hi my name is najah. Im orginally from Somalia but ive spent most of my adult life in the UK.Although im passionate about  several sports
such as squah, swmimming and running, football is my favourite. i was introduced to football as a young child and i loved the ease of just playing the game. 
There are no specail equipment needed to play football and you can play with as little or as many people as you want. I also love the team aspect of the game,
where to win the game everyone on the team as to collabrate and be on the same wavelenth.Technically is also very hard to master.I dont really have a favourite food per say, 
it really just depends on my mood and what im craving that day. Sometimes i really like rasta pasta and other times id be craving biryani. I do like my food to 
have a lot of flavour and hint of spiceness. I dont really listen to music, so i dont have a link to music video, however i do have a favouite video.This video 
is quran recitation by sh sudais with its meaning since im not a native arabic speaker. Some people might consider it to be similairto music because of the nature 
of the recitation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAjq4nXdfoQ.
I can speak three lanuages fluently and can understand two whilst speaking a broken version.
