My name is Bakhat Begum.
My favorite sport is badminton. I like badminton, and I often play badminton with my family members in a club near my home. The reason why I like it is that it always recalls my college memories when I used to play it with my friends and siblings.
My favorite food is biryani. It is our traditional food in Pakistan. It always memories me while I used to cook it with my sweet mother in my home country. I think that is the reason why I like it.
My favorite link of video "https://youtu.be/oXLzfldeDcM".
The interesting fact about myself is whenever I have a nightmare I kick and often cry while I am in asleep.
