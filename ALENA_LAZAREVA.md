Name: Alena Lazareva

Favourite sport: My favorite sport is tennis.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to play myself, but I like to watch the games of professional athletes. Tennis is a game that requires great precision, a high degree of athleticism and great strategy. It also seems to me that this game shows the personalities of the players, because of which the game only becomes more interesting. 

Favourite food: My favorite food is hot chocolate. This drink always reminds me of something joyful, like meeting up with friends at the Christmas market. It warms not only the body, but also the soul.

Link to my favourite music:

Interesting fact: For six years, I volunteered every summer at a camp for kids who loved to play an intellectual games like quizzes and Jeopardy.
