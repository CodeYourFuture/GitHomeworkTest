1. My name is Rahma Gulaid.

I am not really into sports other than yoga, but my favourite sport growing up was rounders, because its fun to play with friends.

I love food, i am a big foodie however I think my favourite food if i had to pick one is rice and chicken because its tasty and filling.

Here is a link to my favourite song; https://youtu.be/0habxsuXW4g . I used to hear this a lot growing up and I never grow tired of it. Mariah is so talented.

One interesting fact is that I come from a family of 11 children! I am the third oldest.
