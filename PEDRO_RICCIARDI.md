#Hello everyone! I'm Pedro Ricciardi

I'm not a huge sports enthusiast. I enjoy volleyball, tennis, and basketball, but I'm not well-versed in the current sports scene. In reality, I have a preference for martial arts like wushu, karate, and tae kwon do. However, I lean more towards being a _nerd_, spending my free time playing games (especially RPGs), watching tech and science videos, studying coding, and so on.

Don't get me wrong; I also love going outside on a sunny day to enjoy some food and drinks at a cozy bakery or a nice pub. When it comes to food, I don't have a specific favorite. It depends on the time, my mood, and the country I'm in. I like to try local dishes, explore new flavors, aromas, and textures. That said, I can say I have a soft spot for seafood and Italian cuisine.

Beyond that, I'm a music enthusiast. Most of the time, if I'm doing something, I'm probably doing it while listening to music. My favorite band is **Pink Floyd**, and my favorite song is **High Hopes**. [Check out this masterpiece!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jF6lStgXTI)

I'm a Brazilian who doesn't have much interest in football, samba, or carnival. I'm more of a nerd, a pen-and-paper RPG player, something of a rocker and metalhead, passionate about science and technology, with a teacher's spirit and a curious mind.
