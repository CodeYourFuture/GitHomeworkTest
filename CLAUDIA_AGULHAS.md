# Git Lesson Homework

Hi my name is Claudia Agulhas from the Western Cape, South Africa.

My favorite sport has to be football. I love how exciting the sport is and because of its large following over the world it has the ability to unite many people.

My favorite food is bean curry. It was my dad's favorite dish also and my mom cooks it fantastic.

Check out one of my favorite songs by Alicia Keys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBl42mCnRGA

A random fact about me is that I can converse in basic French and I love learning languages in my spare time.
