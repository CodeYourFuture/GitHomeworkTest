I'm Ashfak Ahmad Mohamed Najeeb from Sheffield. My favourite sport is Cricket. The reason why I like it is because I use to play only Cricket from my childhood. My favourite food is hoppers. I like this because my mom made in a way where I'll love to eat unlimited (more than my hunger).

An interesting fact about myself is I love to learn newthings by myself and quicklearner.
