Hello World!!

My name is Hozan Ali,

One of my favourite sports is Football, and I support Real Madrid.
The reason I like football is because it brings me joy and happiness when I watch it especially when my team wins.

I don't have a particular favourite cuisine, but I like Pasta, Gelato and Biryani.

I like listening to all kinds of music, which ever is nice to my ears, but this music is one of my few picks when coding while listening to music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veHqJSC-9Lo&ab_channel=LaurentZen

One interesting fact about me is the that when I was a kid I used to do tricks with Nunchaku.
