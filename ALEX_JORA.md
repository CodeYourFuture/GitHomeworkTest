My name is Catalina-Alexandra Jora.

My favorite sport is Fencing. Fencing is an intense sport and uniforms look cool. Fencers learn physical fitness and mental resilience. How to support one another and how to be happy for an opponent.How to get knocked down but then get back again. 

Fish is one of my favorite foods. Since I grew up on the Danube river, fish was a staple in my diet.

First on my list of favorite music is Queen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ.

I love self help books. In Romania, I had one wall filled with them. Since I could not take it all to Cape Town, I continued to collect it electronically. At this point, I probably have over 200 books. Even though I don't always have time to read, if I do have time, I read, take notes, and share what I think is valuable with my friends.
