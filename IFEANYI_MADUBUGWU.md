# Introduction

**Name**: 

Ifeanyi Madubugwu

**Favourite Sport**: 
*Sport Name*: Football

I am a Manchester United fan, and I have been a fan for the past two decades. Football is my favourite sport because, growing up, I used to be a footballer, and this made the sport a significant part of my life. I am always happy whenever my team wins

**Favourite Food**: 
*Food Name*: Vegetable soup and Poundo

Vegetable soup paired with Poundo is a traditional African dish, particularly from the Igbo culture in Nigeria. Growing up in an African home, we had various starchy foods like Poundo, Fufu, Garri, and Semo. However, we often grouped them all under the term "fufu." Vegetable soup became my favourite because of its rich flavour and cultural significance. There was a common saying that eating fufu would make you stronger, as it provides energy due to its high carbohydrate content. I found this to be true—I couldn’t go two weeks without indulging in a hearty meal of fufu and vegetable soup.


**Favourite Music**: Praise (feat. Brandon Lake, Chris Brown & Chandler Moore) | Elevation Worship

Every morning when I wake up, I start my day by listening to Christian praise songs. This particular track helps set a positive tone for my day, uplifting my mood and filling me with gratitude.

**Interesting Fact**:

An interesting fact about me is that I’ve been a passionate Manchester United fan for over two decades, and my love for football stems from my own experience as a footballer growing up. This connection to the sport shaped my outlook on teamwork, resilience, and the joy of celebrating victories—both on and off the field.
