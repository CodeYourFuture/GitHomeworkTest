# Introduction

Hello! My name is Halyna Kozlovska.

## Favourite Sport 🎾
My current favourite sport is tennis. I enjoy it because it combines physical agility, strategic thinking, and endurance. Playing tennis challenges both my body and mind, making every match a rewarding experience.

## Favourite Food 🦪
I absolutely love seafood—especially oysters. Their fresh, briny taste and unique texture make them a delicacy I never get tired of. They remind me of the sea and bring a feeling of luxury to any meal.

## Favourite Music 🎼
One of my favourite pieces of music is “Mariage d’Amour.” It’s a beautifully emotional piano composition that always brings me peace and inspiration.
