Hi, my name is Andrejs Kalnins.
My favourite sport is basketball because it challenges me to learn new skills and I love the social aspect of meeting with others to play a game. 
My favourite food is pasta because it is versatile and can be enjoyed both hot (with delicous sauces) or cold (in salads).
For favourite music, lets give a shoutout to Brazil because I'm feeling the summer vibes right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHbOZBSv18
An interesting fact about me: My earliest memory is my first Christmas. I told my mum many years later what I remember from that day and she could confirm what I said in disbelief.
