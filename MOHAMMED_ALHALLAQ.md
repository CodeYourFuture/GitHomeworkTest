## Hey Coders My name is Mohammed Alhallaq , and here some breif information about me :-)

### My favorite sports are ...

- Biking during the nice weather in the UK is the most lovely sport for me , I enjoy the nature and the weather while I am excersising.
- Diving is the most risky sport I have ever tried , but it's so much exciting and enjoyable sports speacially if the underwater life is colored with different fishes and species .
- Hiking Also one of my favorite sports speacially during the summer in the UK. I enjoy the nature and chatting with my firends while hiking.

### My favorite foods are ...

I like the middleeastern cusine , the Palastenian, Lebaneese , Turkish and Syrian Cusines, they have different dilicious dishes , such as :

- Falafel if it's served and presented with Homous and pickles .
- Makloobah , it's cooked with rice , vigitables and cheken , the speices and the way of cooking making it very tasty.
- Doolma and Mahshi , these are 2 different dishes one is made by stuffing the grape leaves with rice , and the other by stuffing abergine and zucchini with rice .
