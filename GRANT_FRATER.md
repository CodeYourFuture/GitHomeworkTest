👋🏻 Hi, My name is Grant Frater.
🏉 My favourite sport is Rugby because it's a thugs game played by gentlemen.
🍕 My favourite food is Pizza, Who doesn't like pizza?!
🎶 Here's a link to my favourite song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRvEwXDxz_I
📍 I'm from Glasgow but have spent a good chunk of my life in Australia as I have family there and used to go over for months at a time.
