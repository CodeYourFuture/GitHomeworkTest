<Title> Tell Us About You!</title>
<h1> Hi, my name is Rebecca but I prefer to go by Becca</h1>
<p> I don't really enjoy sports because I have dyspraxia which affects my coordination so I end up being terrible at them! I have recently started taking part in pole fitness classes. I like this form of exercise because I can go at my own pace, I'm learning a new skill, and it improves my posture, upper body and core strength, and it is fun!</p>
<p> My favourite food is pasta because it is so versatile and there are so many different dishes you can make with different pastas. My favourite pasta dish to make is lasagne. </p>
<p> An interesting fact about myself is that I am a twin. My sister and I are very different in terms of appearance and personality but we get on very well and I feel very lucky to have grown up with my best friend. </p>
