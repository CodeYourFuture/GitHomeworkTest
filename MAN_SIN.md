Hi, my name is Man Sang Sin. I enjoy going out for cycles when the weather is nice as I find it helps me relax. A favourite food of mine is ramen! It is tasty, quick and easy to make and you can mix it up by adding all sorts of different toppings. I am currently digging some acoustic Twenty One Pilots: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ThQkrXHdh4&list=RDjO2_3pVd5k0&index=5. A not so interesting fact about myself is that I am bilingual; I can speak both english and cantonese.
