Hi, my name is mohammadreza Nafar.
My favorite sport is gym or body building most of the Time I do exercise after work and I like to do this because I get fresh and I have a good feeling.
My favorite food is chicken breast kabab, I choose this one because it doesn't have fat and there is a lot of protein, it's healthy, and after digestion, you don't have any problems such as swelling and stomachache .
This is my favorite video music and i like to share the link:

One of the facts about myself is I couldn't make any food and I didn't know any knowledge about it But after 8 years later I can't cook most of the food, it's not hard to learn in my opinion, just you should have some patience.
