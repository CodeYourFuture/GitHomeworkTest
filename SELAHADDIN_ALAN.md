I like football. I like its simplicity yet it requires a great combination of intelligence, strength and team spirit.
My favorite food is iskender kebab. Best homemade yoghurt and hot tomato sauce on top of grilled lamp meat with pita bread. And the best part of it; it's from Bursa! :)
One of my favorite music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVWEb-At8yc
One interesting fact about me is that according to Turkish prosecutors I tried to overthrown the Turkish government with my father and sister without using a single weapon--facepalm!
