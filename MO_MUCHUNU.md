Hello, my name is Mo Muchunu

My favourite sport is swimming because it's both fun and can be extremely challenging

My favourite food is Sarmale after a friend cooked it for me years ago- really hearty and flavoursome!

One of my absolute favourites Arctic Monkeys- Do me a Favour

An interesting fact about me is that I once performed on Channel 4 Talk show, Richard and Judy as well as at the Royal Albert Hall, when I was in a Gospel choir at secondary school.
