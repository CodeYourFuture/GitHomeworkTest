# Git Lesson Homework

/My name is Hibah , I'm 27 
My favorite sport is Basketball I enjoy the analytical side of the game and also watching with family makes us closer. 
My favorite food is Chilli Con Carne as it's my son's favorite meal and i enjoy making it(from scratch)



I have a favorite song at every stage of my life but lately Don't let the old man in became my jam as it reminds me to always be young and never let the old man in: Link  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc5AWImplfE 

An interesting fact about me is I used to be a makeup artist in music videos and short films!
