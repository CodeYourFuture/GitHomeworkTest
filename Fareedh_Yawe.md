My name is Fareedh Yawe. I am a student at GIC and I am very interested in sports.

My favorite sport is rugby, I used to play it but almost no one believes because I am very small. I like it because I get a chance to prove my self among biger guys than my self and this is challenging but also satisfying if it works out.

My favorite food at the moment is mac and cheese not because i like it but i want to add on my weight, i hope it works.

My favorite song is Dear God by Dax. - https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dear+god

A fact about my self is that I give off confident vibes but I am a really shy person.
