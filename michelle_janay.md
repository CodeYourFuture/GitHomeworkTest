1. Hi! My name is Michelle
2. My favorite sport is soccer, but honestly, I don't really watch or play sports.
3. My favorite food is chocolate, because it is so so tasty.
4. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWg9HEomLs) to listen to one of my favorite songs.
5. An interesting fact about myself is that I was actually born in England. I have an American accent, so it always surprises people when I say I was born in Ipswich.
