##### Favourite Sport:

Not really into sports, maybe eventually cycling though after seeing Chris Broad and CDawgVA cycle from Hokkaido to Toranomon Hills in tokyo.

##### Favourite Food:

Gyudon, what is better than a simple bowl of rice with thinly sliced beef with onions and a sweet sauce.

##### Favourite Song:

[Re: I Am - Aimer](https://youtu.be/ptwH69_0EAo)


##### Fun fact:

10 years ago i got on the Osaka loop line intending to go to Nara only to figure out after 30mins that i was going the wrong way round.
