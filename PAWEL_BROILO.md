Football is my favourite Sport. I like it because Football is a very common Sport. I like playing it and watchinch it. I also think it has a lot of elements to it like running and quick strategic thinking and decision making.
I like all Cusines because each one has a Tasty dish to offer. Also I think Italian and Chineese are good Cusines. I like Spaghetti and Pizza. I like Sweet & Sour Chicken.
