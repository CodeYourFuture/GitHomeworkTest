My Favourite Sport
My favourite sport is rugby. I enjoy rugby since childhood because of the skill set and strenght you must have to overcome yopur opponent. Playing rugby is about how big your heart is and not your muscle. I like to watch New Zealand play rugby because of their flair and their players have so much talent and great attitude. The all time favourite players is Zinzan Brooke because of his iron tackling than Richie McCaw because of his great leadership and awesome skills. 

My Favourite Food
Curry - especially chicken curry, just love the flavour and spicyness lekker hot. Both my parents make very nice curry and I have been growing iup with it almost three to four times a week

Back in the day I was a very shy person and when it came to getting awards I would hide, I did not like being in the spotlight. In comparison to now I would talk to anyone and be confident within groups as I became converted in 2008 I changed completely a whole metamorphosis took place. Since childhood as far as I can remember I wanted to be an electronic engineer, well I loved learning and still do and not someone that give up. I love to solve problems, sometimes not immediately but give me time and will will find the solution. I was three years old and could've draw cartoons what i have seen on the tv like He-man, thundercats etc. When I went to school the first day the teacher sent me to the principal's office with my drawing, I still can remember how scared I was because I thought what did I do wrong because I have sketched Thundercats characters as is. Only to find out they were impressed by it, that's why my family thought I am going in the career of being an artist or something.
