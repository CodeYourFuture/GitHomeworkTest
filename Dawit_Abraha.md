My name is Dawit Abraha
My favorite sport is Basketball. I simply enjoy it for no particular reason.
Doro wet is my favorite food because it is one of my cultural food.
Here's a link to my favorite music video: https://youtu.be/VitKvID-uvY
I learnt Origami by simply watching and following youtube videos and now I can create different kinds of Origami as a hobby.
