# Introduction about me:

My name is Sheetal Kharab, and I am from India.
 My favorite sport is cricket because it is very popular in India and brings people together, creating a sense of unity and excitement. 
 I am vegetarian, and my favorite food is Chole Bhature, a delicious North Indian street food that is famous for its flavorful spices and soft bread. 
 My favorite music is old Bollywood songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, whose melodious voice has a timeless charm.
Here’s a link to a YouTube playlist of Lata Mangeshkar’s timeless songs:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs4Ob8KiGL8
I really enjoy cooking and can make a variety of North Indian sweets and street food. One of the most challenging dishes I’ve tried is Ghevar, a traditional North Indian sweet. Despite its complexity, I successfully made it, and my kids loved it, which makes me proud!
