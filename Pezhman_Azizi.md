# Git Lesson Homework

1) Hi my name is Pezhman Azizi.

2) It has been always hard for me to answer this question as there are two favoutite sprts. Parkour and Mountain biking because of the great deal of freedom feeling they provide. Plus I love adventure so doing MTB you are always out there. 

3) My favourite food is Persian food called Ghormeh Sabzi. The reason for that is simply because it remindes of home and family reunians we had and lunch time round the table long fun talks with family and friennds.


4)  Here is my favourite music I have been listening recently. " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4CcX720D4 ". 

5) I play guitar and scketch in my free time.
