Hello! My name is Zahraa Tayyar.

My favourite sport is swimming, and I enjoy going to the gym in general to take care of my health.

My favourite food is Dolma.

My favourite song is Grenade by Bruno Mars because it is very nostalgic to me. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR6iYWJxHqs .

An interesting fact about me is I can write backwards in cursive.
