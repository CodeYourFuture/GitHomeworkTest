How Goes!

My name - in full - is Deago, Recaldo, Eugene, Browne.
I never really use my middle names, but you are welcome to use them if you feel like it - as they are also my name.

My friends generally call me Digz.
I inherited this alias when I was 15, and it later became the moniker I used as a DJ (DJ Digz).

I don't have a favourite sport, but I'll list some sports that I like/appreciate.

Sports I L/A, and have/do actively participate in:

- Martial Arts -- I appreciate the way it looks & feels, the skill involved, and the ability to track your proficiency in real-time.
- Skateboarding -- see above
- Pool/Snooker -- see above

Sports I L/A but have not/do not participate in:

- Snowboarding -- see above
- Archery/Marksmanship -- see above
- Motorsports -- see above
- Cricket -- see above

I don't have a favourite food, but some dishes/desserts/pastries that I like:

- Croissants -- 3-day job, a successful batch feels like an achievement.

- Ramen -- Good ramen is like consuming an elixir. Best ramen experience so far was at Tonkotsu on the Narrow Way in Hackney.

- Panettone -- Love how it tastes, great with coffee, could eat a whole one in one sitting; especially those imported from Italy.

- Carbonara -- simply in its ingredients, unique and wonderful in its taste, challenging to master.

- Coffee -- 'Nuff said (must be filtered).

One of my all-time favourite tracks is "God's Bathroom Floor" - by Atmosphere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f70vYOHlkps

An interesting fact:

I enjoy Cloth-making and Textiles, and I own a sewing machine (it's a Singer).

I have so far in the past made a T-Shirt, a felt hat, and a Rucksack; this was supposed to be a gift for my daughter, but I was unable to finish it, and now I do not feel skilled enough yet to do so.

I would like to set up my own clothing business at some point in the future; striking a balance between formal and casual in a way that could appeal to a wide demographic - influenced in part by 90's Hip Hop, and traditional African & Asian attire.

PEACE !!!
