My name is Mustafa Acar. 
My favourite sport is running. It is easy and cheap to do it. You just need a trainer. Then you can run everywhere. It makes you healthier. 
My favourite food is vine rolls from Turkish kitchen. Firstly it can be cooked as suitable for vegan and vegeterian diet. Then it is incredibly delicious. Vine leaves are extremely nutritious and have strong antioxidant properties as well. 
I like enstrumental musics and folk songs. You can finde one of my favourite music [here]: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKKgzVhMgY)


And I can read very fast, approximately 1000 words per minute.
