Hey there! 👍

My name is Wanda, I'm part of CYF trainee 2022.
I'm very begginer at codding and I'm very exiting to to start this year my pathway to the tech industry.⌨️👩🏽‍💻💷🖥

Appart of studying codding I enjoy the evenings with inline skating, also going to the gym,🏃🏼‍♀️🏋️‍♀️ I also love swimming 🩱🏊‍♀️ two times a week.

My favorite food is pasta in with extra chees, why is it my favorite, because I love pasta.🍝

I like music in general
