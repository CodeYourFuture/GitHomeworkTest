Hey there! 

My name is Wanda, I'm part of CYF trainee 2022.
I'm very begginer at codding and I'm very exiting to to start this year my pathway to the tech industry.

Appart of studying codding I enjoy the evenings with inline skating, also going to the gym, I also love swimming two times a week.

My favorite food is pasta in with extra chees, why is it my favorite, because I love pasta.

I like music in general 
but here is a link of my favorite one:
