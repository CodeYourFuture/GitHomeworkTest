My name is Shohreh Bayat, and my favourite sport is football. Football is easy to understand, and it allows you to discuss over the game with other people, due to its popularity around the world.
My favourite food is a traditional dish from Iran, which is called "GhormehSabzi". It is hugely important in persian culture and at the same time it is extremely delicious. You can cook it either with meet or in a vegetarian style.
My favourite music is a persian song by Mohsen Chavoshi: https://youtu.be/3QgPsiedxd0 I love deep musics.
An interesting fact about me is that I love traveling and I have been to around 30 countries so far! Learning about new countries and cultures is a great way to educate myself.
