My name is **Appolin Semegni Fotso**, I live in **Glasgow** and I am a trainee at **Code Your Future**.  
Football is my favourite sport because I grew up playing and watching it.  
My favourite food is a traditional dish from my home country. I like it because it is **organic** and full of freshness.  
[This is a link to my favourite song called "This Woman's Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkeCNeHcmXY). This is **Maxwell**'s version, but it was originally sang by **Kate Bush**.  
I was in a football club when I was a boy. And I speak more than two languages.
