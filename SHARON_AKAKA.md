Your name: Sharon Akaka

Your favourite sport and why you like it:
I really enjoy Netball because it is a high speed sport. I first played netball when I was 11 years old and was genuinely one of the most exciting sports I played.

Your favourite food and why it's your favourite:
My favourite food is Jollof rice. As a Nigerian, it is a dish you can't really go really wrong with it. It is extremely flavoursome dish and the ideal meal for celebrations.

An interesting fact about yourself - impress us!
I say this often but I had a pet monkey when I was a child and living in Nigeria. However, what is not so impressive was that he did not open bananas like I expected. Instead of peeling the banana, he always banged the banana on the floor to split it.
