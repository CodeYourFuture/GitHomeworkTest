Hello I am Justinas Brazauskas. 
My favorite sport is swimming, I like it. Because I grew up close  to the lakes and rivers. 
I really enjoy being in nature, cycling in parks, and walking long distances. I try to keep a balance with my body and mind. 
My favorite food is Saltibarksciai. I love this food, it's a very  special Lithuanian cold soup with crispy potatoes.It’s absolutely fantastic to refresh yourself on a hot summer day and sure,  very delicious. 
I put a link  to one of my favorite song: shallou - You and Me | Nomad Series.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1trifshoIw0
I guess everyone of us is unique, so my favorite things enjoy every single moment, because cosmos it’s amazing and unique. I am passionate about learning new things. People say that I’m energetic and naturally evolving in others who stand around me when I do exercising 

Thank you for reading my short story about myself.
