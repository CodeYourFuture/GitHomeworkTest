Hi, my name is Khalil Alhaydr and I live in London.
I moved to London in January 2022 after starting a job as compliance analyst.
I like football. I used to play football when I was a child but not any more. I like football because it's a team sport, where pople will play togther and enjoy their time. In addition, people can socialise after the end of the match.
My favorite food is Kibbeh. The ingrediants of Kibbeh (bulgur wheat, ground meat, onions and nuts) are mixing toghter to provide the most delicious test I ever tried.
I like music and I usually listen to Arabic music and rarly to English songs. Here is a link to my favorite song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GgfjmqKbM8
