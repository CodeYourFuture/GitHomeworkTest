My name is Halla .

My favourite sport is Cycling .
I cycle for 1-2 hours per day .I like cycling because it is very healthy. also it is better for the environment .
Cycling can practice our muscles and it can strengthen our heart and lung. It gives a feeling of freedom. 
you donâ€™t need to worry about the traffic jam at all or to think about the parking places .
