Hi,
My name is Kerim Zamir.

My favourite Sport is Football, because I can often hangout with my friends and forget about Work that I need to do.

My favourite food is seafood that my dad cooks, I love the food since its spicy, but not too spicy. While also maintaining its Texture.

My favourite music:

An interresting thing about me is that I love to program so much that I can compare it to when I am playing games.
