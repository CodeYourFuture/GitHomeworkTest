Hello!!
My Name is Konika Biswas
I don't have a particular favourite Sport, I like gardening more than anything. I love sowing seeds and seeing them germinated, shooting new leaves and soon growing big enough to give flowers and fruits. I love the process of creation and hybernation of plants. 

My favorite food is pilau rice and Fish curry. I am a Bnagladeshi, these are our staple food. The country has plenty of rice and fish.
I like ed Sheeran . One of my favorite song played by him is here;
