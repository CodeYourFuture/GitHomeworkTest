Hi, my name is Humail Khan!

Generally, I am not a very sporty person but my favourite sport is Cricket. It runs in my family. My dad was a first-class cricketer, my cousins are first-class cricketers and my uncle was a famous international cricketer. So I have a very interesting bond with cricket.

My favourite food is Biryani. I am very passionate about my cooking skills and I am always on the lookout to make it better every time. I just love biryani and it has so many variations to it. I believe I am quite good at making proper restaurant style biryani, but it is always a challenge to perfect it. I keep trying newer ways to perfect the taste even further.

My favourite musician is Ustaad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. A world renowned Pakistan legend. He was a Qawwal but I really like his collaboration with Michael Brook, which was nominated for a Grammy as the world's best album in 1997. All his songs and Qawwalis are really good but one of my favourite is My Heart, My Life - Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan & Michael Brook.

My interesting facts are that I am fluent at speaking 4 languages(English, French, Urdu, Punjabi) and I have already lived and worked in 4 different countries around the world (France, United Kingdom, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates).

I know my introduction is a bit lengthy but my choices are not conventional or not mostly from the western world. Therefore, I had to elaborate to give a little background into it. Thank you.
