My name is Anderson Ferreira but you can call me Andy! 

In the past, I did many sports such as Judo, Capoeira, Swimming but for now, Trekking is a sport that more fishes my attention and I like it because it is a way where I can be in contact with nature.

My favourite food is lasagna. Besides the delicious flavour, I think I'm attached to infant memories of all family eating lasagna on Sunday's in my past grandfather's house.

This is just one of my thousands of favourites: https://youtu.be/au8rHGvytn8

When I was 18 years old I gave Dreamweaver classes for engineers and architects who weren't happy with their careers and also I used to go to an orphanage to teach kids how to use a computer.
