Hi, I'm Matilda Ako and here is a little about me.

I'm not a sports fan and have never really enjoyed sports so I don't have a favourite.

My favourite food is a Ghanaian dish called Banku and Okro soup, it's very filling and you can make it many different ways, the textures and flavours also really compliment each other.

My favourite music is a Ghanaian style called afrobeats, one of my favourite songs is called Dzigbordi by Lord Paper. A link to it is youtube.com/watch?v=U8rAUdYJ6R8.

An interesting fact about me is that I love to repair things, if an electronic device is broken, I will open it up to repair it, the same with things around the house, I will try and repair it before calling someone to do it for me.
