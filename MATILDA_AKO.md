Hi, I'm Matilda Ako and here is a little about me.

I'm not a sports fan and have never really enjoyed sports so I don't have a favourite.

My favourite food is a Ghanaian dish called Banku and Okro soup, I really love Ghanaian foods so it was hard to choose just one but I chose this as it's very filling and you can make it many different ways by changing the meat or fish in the soup and they can also be left out so catering to the vegetarian and vegan community, the textures and flavours also really compliment each other.

My favourite music is a Ghanaian style called afrobeats, one of my favourite songs is called Dzigbordi by Lord Paper, it is a love song about a guy who loves a girl but her parents hate him simply because he is from a different tribe than she is. A link to it is [found here](youtube.com/watch?v=U8rAUdYJ6R8).

An interesting fact about me is that I love to repair things, if an electronic device is broken, I will open it up to repair it, the same with things around the house, I will try and repair it before calling someone to do it for me.
