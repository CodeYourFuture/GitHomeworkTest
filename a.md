Hi, my name is Chris Owen!

My favorite sport is running because I find it relaxing. Last year, I was training for a marathon but it was cancelled ðŸ˜¥

My favorite food is Taka Daal - so easy to make and so delicious!

One of my favorite tracks is Sheila by Jamie T

My interesting fact is that I lived in Greece for a year where I was running a Code School.

Thanks for reading!
