I'm Tajudeen Oyehan, a PhD student and Software Development trainee at the Code Your Future bootcamp.
My favorite sport is football. The physicality, teamwork, strength, smartness and quick-thinking required while playing the game makes soccer football an interesting game to me.
I love deliciously prepared beans and plantain popularly called 'dodo'. This is one of Nigerian dishes. It has a unique taste and is rich in proteins, vitamins and minerals.
