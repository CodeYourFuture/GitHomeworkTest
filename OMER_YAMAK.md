Hi, my name is Omer Yamak!

My favorite sport is football. I have been playing football for almost 20 years. I love football because I enjoy team sports. Football includes cooperation, communication, challenge and intelligence. Kicking the ball with aiming to score is a real pleasure for me :). 

My favorite food is any food without garlic :)). I like any food my mother makes. To name one though, I do like rice with roasted chicken. I like to eat food with rice and roasted chicken is one of my favorites. 

I listen to music every day. I have various playlists. Some of them are to be listened to concentrate, some of them are to be listened to get relaxed, and some of them are for fun. Recently, I have been listening to "Jest Oldu" by "Karsu", a Turkish pop song. It's my current favorite song.

My interesting fact is that I attempted to learn Chinese in high school for two years. Not surprisingly, I only managed to learn basics :).

Thanks for reading!
