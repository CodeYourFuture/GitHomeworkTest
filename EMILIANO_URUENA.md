Hi,
-My name is Emiliano Uruena

-My favourite sport is football. I like it because good football requeares different habilities, be smart, fast, and good at teamwork. I also find interesting how many people get excited because of it.

-My favourite food is "Bandeja Paisa" because it's a delicious mix of flavours and textures.

-This is a link of a song I love: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eguctGjUNLI

-I'm from Colombia, a country known for its happiness and cultural richness. I consider myself a family manâ€”I really enjoy spending time with my daughters, siblings, cousins, nephews, and nieces. Every year, we have a fabulous three-day family gathering full of games, food, and fun.
