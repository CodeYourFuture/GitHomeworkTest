My name is Nahom Mesfin, I am a huge football fan. Mainly because I grow up playing football. Now I enjoy watching football as a Manchester United fan except for this season which we perforemed terribly in the premier league. My favourite food is a cultural dish called ketfo. which is a delicacy in my country. It is made from beef and other different spices and ingredients that are infused together to make one delicious meal.

An interesting fact about myself would be my cooking skills. I am a very good at cooking my cultural dishes as well as some dishes from various cultures. I am open to learn and master more diverse dishes in the future.
