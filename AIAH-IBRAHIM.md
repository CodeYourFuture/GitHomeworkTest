   1. My name is Aiah
   2. My favorite sport is walking while listening to music. I enjoy it because it helps me stay active and boosts my mood.
   Combining movement with music allows me to relax, reflect, and recharge.
   3. My favorite food is figuada because it reminds me of my cultural roots and family gatherings. 
   The rich flavors and comforting taste make it special, and itâ€™s always a treat to share it with loved ones.
