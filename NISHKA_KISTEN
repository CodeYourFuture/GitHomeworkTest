My name is Nishka Kisten.

My favourite sport is Kickboxing.
I like Kickboxing because it is interesting and fun to watch. I want to learn kickboxing so that I can be more active and learn how to defend myself.

My favourite food is Chops.
My gran always made 'yellow chops' as I would call it. It's my favourite because it reminds me of her and its very delicious.

My favourite music is Kpop.
Here is a link to one of the groups I listen to: https://youtu.be/jns3bag4aQM

An interesting fact about myself is that I love to paint. I get excited buying paint brushes. It is one of my favourite things to do.
