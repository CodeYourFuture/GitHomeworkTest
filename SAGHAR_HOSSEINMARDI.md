My name is Saghar Hosseinmardi.

My farvoutite Sport is Swimming, it makes me relax and also when i swim it takes all the tensions from my body and my mind away.

My favourite food is Iranian Style Pasta and i lovE this food because everytime i eat it, it reminds me my childhood and my mum's delicious cooking.

This is my favourite song these days https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPyHuCZzsVA, and The song follows a pattern, where each lyrics begins with the word “For…”, to express yearning for simple social freedoms in Iran or outrage over oppression under the Islamic Republic.

An interesting fact about me is i love Fashion and Makeup industry so much. These are the topics i never get tired of them.
