My name is Emily Barton
My favourite sport is darts, i enjoy playing and watching. I think  darts can be enjoyed by all different tyoes of people and isn't subjected to just physically fit.
My favourite food is mac and cheese, however since becoming vegan it is a lot harder to find ready made. I like it because its easy, nutritious and creamy.
Here is a link to my favourite song at the moment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-UFBixnUT4
An interesting fact about myself is I have visted over 12 different countries and intend to visit many more in the future.
