name: Haliema adiem
favorite sport: Hiking, I like it because it allows me to enjoy the nature around me.
My favorite food is veg+cheese pasta and vegetable soupe, I like it because I think it gives more nutritions.
Actually I don't have one favorite song, but I think I like listening to this song most of the times https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY1Ue0ykOrA
I like cooking and I cook 3 to 5 days a week, but most of times I don't like what I cooked.
