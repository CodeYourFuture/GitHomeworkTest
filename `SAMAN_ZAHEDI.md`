My name is Saman Zahedi
I used to like football but not anymore since it`s becoming a sport where wealthy teams come to attack against other teams who come to defend aka park the bus, I watch tennis and snooker finals in my spare time because it`s totally unpredictable.
I like traditional Kurdish soup called Dokliw because it`s full of fresh vegetables and it`s the best starter.
Here`s a link to one of my favourite song`s link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y6smkh6c-0
I performed as a singer for our universtiy`s band and I won football trophies with my high school and university teams
