Hi!
1. I'm Hussein Al-Sayed
   2. My favourite sport must be freeruning (freestyle parkour).
   3. I generally don't have favourites in anything, and food is no exception (I eat anything lol). 
   4. This is a tough one, it'll take me days if I have to decide.
   5. On a long day last summer, I went on a +12 hrs bike ride around Glasgow. I have it on strave if u wanna see it :)
