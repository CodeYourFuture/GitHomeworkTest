My favourite sport is volleyball because when I was a child, we used to watch volleyball matches together as a family and it made me happy, especially because my mum would prepare snacks


My favourite food is broccoli with pomegranate sauce and salmon because it’s both healthy and very delicious.

One interesting fact about me is that when I was working at a café, I used to do funny and creative things to make customers laugh and lift their mood. I'm extremely shy when I first meet people, but once I get comfortable, I become very fun and helpful.
