Plus, it’s a truly global sport that connects people from all backgrounds.
My favourite food is Indian Cuisine .Indian food is my favorite because it’s a vibrant celebration of flavors, spices, and textures. From the creamy richness of butter chicken to the fiery heat of spicy vindaloo, every dish has a unique personality. I love the variety of options, whether it’s the comforting taste of dal makhani, the crispy crunch of samosas, or the fragrant aroma of biryani. Indian food is also about more than just taste—it’s deeply connected to culture, tradition, and family, making every meal a meaningful experience.
