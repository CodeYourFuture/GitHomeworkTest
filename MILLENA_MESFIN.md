Hi there! 👋

My name is Millena Mesfin, and I’m excited to tell you a bit about myself.

My favourite sport is basketball 🏀. I love it because it’s fast-paced, full of energy, and really brings people together as a team. There's nothing like the thrill of a last-second shot!

When it comes to food, my absolute favourite is kimchi. I love how fresh and flavorful it is—plus, there’s so much variety that I never get bored of it.

As for music, here’s a video of one of my all-time favourite songs:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ3ZWO_63MI (Abraham Afewerki).And here’s an interesting fact about me:I’ve read over 50 books in a single year.
