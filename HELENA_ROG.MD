        ◦ My name: Helena Rog (just Helen :)
          
        ◦ My favourite sport and why I like it: hiking and trekking in the mountains. Last time I climbed Czantoria Wielka/ Velká Čantoryje which is a cross border Poland/Czech mountain. I like mountaineering because it gives me a sense of accomplishment and conquer. Besides, I like tennis and badminton and in good weather I play with my son. I like it because it improves concentration and focus.
          
        ◦ My favourite food and why it's my favourite: Trying to thing hard but I don’t have a favourite food. 
          
        ◦ A link to a video of my favourite music: I like all sorts of music but mostly orchestral and classical and to some extent- power metal. I tend to steer towards instrumental music, lyrics are not that important to me but if there are any, they better be meaningful. On a normal basis I binge listen to all albums by Two Steps From Hell and Audiomachine.  I also like music by Hanz Zimmer , Zack Hemsey, Max Richter, Sabaton, Rodrigo y Gabriela.

        ◦ An interesting fact about yourself - impress us! Not quite sure what is impressive or interesting about me. I am a very average human, trying to be a better person day by day.
