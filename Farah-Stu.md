My name is Fatima Belkedari, also known as Farah.

I’m passionate about two sports: tennis and equestrian. When I’m doing either, I lose track of time because I enjoy them so much.

When it comes to food, I don’t have one specific favorite, but I do prefer traditional Algerian dishes, such as couscous and tajine.

Here’s one of my favorite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLqZtded_0

A fact about me: I’m a kind and caring person who loves to help others. I’m passionate about IT and working hard to break into the tech industry. I speak four languages: Arabic, French, English, and a little bit of Spanish.
