My name is Tosin Odunuga

My Favourite Sport is Football, I love Playing football, and I support Manchester United. Compared to other sports, there is no sport that can cause suspense and excitement for players like football. In this regard, football clearly has the effect of relieving stress and bringing people together, as a remedy to help me temporarily forget the worries and worries of daily life.

My favourite Food is fried rice with Fish. I enjoy eating Fried rice with fish to the extent that I can eat it three times a day.
