My favourite sport is surfing which I have never tried it before. When I watch on TV someone surfs, I love the way they look free.
I LOVE iskender, which is Turkish tradional kebap from Bursa. ‘İskender Kebab’ is the way of serving vertically roasted lamb meat slices, known as ‘Döner Kebab’, on a thin crust ‘Pide’ bread with tomato sauce, melted sheep butter and yogurt. I like it a lot because of the combionation of these ingredients is killer. :)

An interesting fact about myself - I love dancing and acting. I can dance salsa, bachata, tango, merengue and hip hop etc. Acting is still on process though! :)
