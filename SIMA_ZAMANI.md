My favourite sport is Football. I like football because it is a very fun and socialable sport. An other reason, I like Football is because it is a team's game and you need to work effecively as a team to win the game. I also, like the fact that it is not a very lengthy game and you can find out who wins or looses at the end of each match which is exciting. If you have a football club that you support. I love Arsenal football club, so therefore am a big Gunner fan.
I love Persian/Afghan food because we are rich in variety when it comes to flavours. My favourite Afghan food is called Qabuli Palow, which is made up of lamb shank,rice, caramalised carrots, raisins, garnished with pistachios and almonds.

An interesting fact about me would be that last year I applied to be a Detective after having volunteered with London Met Police during the pandemic. However, I changed my mind as I loved coding more and I realised where my true potential might be which is to be in software and technology.
