Hi, my name is Joanna.
My favorite sport is jogging. I love it because after running I always feel a lot more energy and have better mood.

I really like Italian kitchen - especially pizza and spaghetti. This is my favorite food because I love tomatoes and I think Italian kitchen is very healthy.

A link to my favorite song that always make me happy when I have a bad mood:

An interesting fact about me is that when I was younger I played in the football team.
