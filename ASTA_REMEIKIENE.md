My name is Asta Remeikiene.

I am not a sports person, but I do like hiking very much as a leisure activity.

I like potato dishes. For example, grated potato pancakes. There is no reason, I just love potatoes!

Here is the link to one of my favourite music pieces: https://youtu.be/cbB3iGRHtqA . Don't read into the words too much thou, just feel the energy!

An interesting fact about myself - I like to knit and crochet.
