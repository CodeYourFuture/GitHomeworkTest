An interesting fact about me...
I am from Namibia, from the capital called Windhoek West. I was born and raised there until I was about Thirteen years of age before i moved down to cape town.
I've been living in Cape Town ever since.
I attended Belhar high arts school
I learnt to read and write music and well ass play the piano and guitar . as side from that
I'd like to think of myself as one whom possess a technical mind ,  I enjoy technology all accepts of it.
I also enjoy being a Tattoo artist in my free time, I also have 17 tattoos on my body 8 of which I have done myself.

About two years ago I started to learned   (cyber security ) Ethical hacking and Web penetration Testing where I’ve learnt so much about web exploration .
my long-term goal is to become a full Stack Web developer to understand how coding works in order to break it down and reverse engineer it. To find loop Holes and vulnerabilities within the source code to prevent hackers from exploiting these websites or application .

My end Goal is to finish my ethical hacking course after I finish the course for full stack developer and combine what I’ve learnt from both courses and start my own Cyber Security company where I will then teach students all that I’ve learnt and is yet to learn.
