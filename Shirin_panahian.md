my favorite sport is swimming because i love the water. It always calmed me to be near it.If I have a day when I’m feeling anxious or stressed, I find swimming keeps my thoughts centered and helps me relax.

kebab is my favorite food because it has a high protein content and It’s easy to cook, versatile and quick. All of these make it perfect for your diet. Plus it’s low in calories
