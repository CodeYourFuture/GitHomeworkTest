My name is Ozioma-Victoria-Ukaonu

I my favorite sports are Football and Tennis
1. I love football because it is a typical example of 'team playing', everyone brings their best to achieve a 'Goal'.This is the attitude and mindset needed as a Developer.
2. I love tennis because on the lawn you are alone with the opponents,no other team mate is involved with you and you cant even consult your coach when things are going wrong,you have to think fast on your feet and know when to change strategies If/when things are going wrong. This should also be an Attribute/character/outlook/Mindset of a Dev Op,you have to be a continuos leaner,able to think fast and be creative,a problem solver who even though you will work mostly as a team whenever you work alone you are able to recognize where to bring in changes.

My favorite Food is Rice
1. I have loved rice since childhood,so i cant really say why,all i know is that it gives my palate a very satisfying feeling.
2. It can be any type,White rice and tasty sauce,Jollof rice,stir-fry rice,Fried Rice.
