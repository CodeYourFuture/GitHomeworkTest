# Git Lesson Homework

To complete this homework you should use the Git workflow you've been learning this week.

1. Fork this repository to create a version where you are the owner
2. Clone the fork to your local machine
3. Open the local repository in VSCode
4. In VSCode, create a local branch called `bio-page`
5. Create a new file called `FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.md`
   - For example, if your name is Joe Smith then call your file `JOE_SMITH.md`
6. In this file, write an introduction yourself. You should include:
   1. Your name
   2. Your favourite sport and why you like it
   3. Your favourite food and why it's your favourite
   4. A link to a video of your favourite music
   5. An interesting fact about yourself - impress us!
7. `Commit` the file to your branch
8. `Push` the branch `bio-page` to your fork

## Creating a pull request

Finally, you'll need to get others to review your work! 
You can do this by creating a **pull request**!

To learn more about **pull requests** and how to create one, please use this guide ðŸ‘‰ https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/guides/create-a-pull-request

9. Open a `Pull Request` to this repository

## Finished Work

When you've finished you should have a `pull request` that looks like this

## Asking for Help

If you've had problems with any of the steps above, ask for help on Slack - another trainee or a volunteer will be able to help you!

When you ask for help you should always say what exactly isn't working

**Do not write:** "Git doesn't work. Can someone help me?"

**Do write:** "I've tried to push my file using git but it's giving me this error XYZ. I've tried to search Google for the answer but I can't find anything. Can somebody help me?"
