My name is Seyed Sharifi.
My favourite sport is football, I like football because it is a team sport, everyone has their specific role and they have to carry out their job properly in order to win the game.
My favourite food has to be home-made chicken Jalfraizi with side dishes of Okra, Chickpeas, Cauliflower accompanied by garlic Naan and cucumber rita. You have to have Popodams and a complete pickle tray.
This song always gets me going specially this version and the reason behind making this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1bM3rpaFKI.
One interesting fact about me is that I run 40K every week!!
