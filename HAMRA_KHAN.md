1) I'm Hamra.
2) My favourite sport is tennis because its a great form of exercise and you can play with multiple people. It also improves your hand eye coordination.
3) It's difficult to pick a favourite food (I like them all!) but if I had to pick it would be Biryani because it is made up of chicken and rice and its spicy which is a bonus :)
4) Link to one of my favourite songs, a classic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM
5) An interesting fact about myself would be I love art and design! I used to sketch and paint a lot and design images on photoshop/illustrator.
