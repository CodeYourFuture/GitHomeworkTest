MY name is Ben Ojika
My favouriyte sport is football, I am actually not a fan of any club, I just enjoy watching good games to see the skills and powress of individual players and teams.
I understand there is a certain level of tribesmanship that exists within the football culture that I dont adhere to so every season, I pick a team I think would do well and support them for the season.
That said, I have no allegience to any team, so if they begin to fall off the top of the league (EPL) table, I port to a better performing team.
It has nothing to do with loyalty and everything to do with seeking excellence and associating with a winning culture.
My favourrite food would be Jollof Rice, this would be due to its spectacular array of flavours and spices.
My favourite video would be any meaningful track from eminem, let us have one linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bCLPwzSC0
I am unable to add significant weight, i was a very skinny child and in my teens i tried to add body mass by eating anything and everything i could find. During the lockdown, when everyone was conplaining about adding weight, i had no such issue.
Thank you for reading through.
