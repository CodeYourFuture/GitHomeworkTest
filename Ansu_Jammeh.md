Fact about myself- when i was young about the age of 5-6, i was always afraid 
to take shower , especially when i went with my age mates to play football when i am back home i will be very messy . my mum will take me to the shower and clean me everytime i came back, whenever i come back my mum will say go to the shower and wait for me am coming so you can take shower i said mum but i take shower yesterday and am still clean wait till tomorrow. if i know now there is no way out i must take shower i will run out in the street i was a very good runner then my brother will chase me but they cannot catch me as i was very quick.

This is a joke -
my favorite machine at the gym is the vending machine.
