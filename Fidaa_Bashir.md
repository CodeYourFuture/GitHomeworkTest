My name is Fidaa Bashir
My favourit sport is hiking, I think it's the perfect way to release life's negative energ and reconnect with the beauty of the nature.
My favourite food is the Palestinian Makloubeh"Upside down", because it's very tasty, it combines the layers of vegtables and spiced rice together.I also like the Palestinian Falafel, we eat it with vegtables, chili paste and tahini sauce with homemade bread, it tastes heavenly!
One of my most favourit music the the Andalusi Muwashah in Arabic " lma bada yatathana" https://youtu.be/EE8cHyjCNLE?feature=shared
