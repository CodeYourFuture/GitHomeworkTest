My name is Amelia.
I like walking for hours, because it is meditative, I can think about many things whilst I do that.
My favourite food is "Pierogi". It's a polish dish made with potatoes, quark and flour pastry.
One of my favourite artists is Tarrus Riley. Here is the link to his song "Simple blessings" on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcXS4QLTF-8
One fact about me is that I spent a couple of months living and volunteering in Kenya and I would love to live there premanently.
