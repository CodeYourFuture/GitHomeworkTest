My name is Olena
1.My favourite sport is Snowboarding. I like it because it combines elements of surfing, skateboarding and skiing. It is very beautiful sport.

2.My favourite food is a pizza. Well, mozzarella, tomatoes and parmesan all contain 4-methylpentanoic acid. That means that, according to food pairing theory, they’re a match made in heaven!

3.A link to one of my favourite music redio is https://www.radio.net/s/vipdeephouse

4. An interesting fact about myself: If I could travel anywhere right now I would go to USA and take part in The Rebelle Rally, which is the first women’s off-road navigation rally raid in the United States.
