My favorite sport is hockey. I like it because it is intense and often has more goals than football.

Favorite dish. Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes and lingonberry. It reminds of my grandmothers cooking and it is tasty and fairly quick to do.

I have a secret recipe on my meatballs that I cannot say. They are very tasty meatballs.
