My name is Tenzin Samdup. Its a Tibetan name. 
My farourite sports are swimming, football and diving.
I like being in the water and play with it. Definitely not continuous lap swimming.
Just casual swimming and springboard diving. I prefer outdoor swimming, as in a lido or sea.
Diving in deep sea is an exhilirating sport for me. 
But I haven't got an opportunity to play football for years now. It is such a fun game to play. 
There is quite a lot of joy drippling, passing and scoring a goal. Lots of serotonin! It also keeps you very healthy.
Football also helps you build good relation and friendship with your playmates. But I don't like to do much heading as there is risk of getting concussion.
My favourite food is quite diffucult to pick as there lots of foods that are my favourites. Strangely not one of them is better than the other.
So I will mention as few as possible. It includes Biryani, Noodles in soup, pho, momo. Biryani a is multi-spice, rice dish with meat. 
Unlike fried rice, its the aroma of the spices that makes biryani taste so good with the sauces and other conditments that complement it.
Noodles in soup and pho are scrupmtious because of their broth. 
Momo is not appetiser but main course for us. They are succullent and tasty with hot chilli sauce.

Interesting fact: I am from a country that is not recognized by the world. You can guess it from the hint dropped already in this work.
