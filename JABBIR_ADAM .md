  My name is Jabir adam , and My favorite sport is football, and I like watching football on TV. I am quite fond of badminton, especially in the winter evenings, mainly because it helps me stay active and socialize. For example, I often play this sport at the community center, particularly in the evenings. and Among the number of food, Pizza is my favourite food because it tastes and smells fabulous. The pizza itself looks so yummy, crispy and so cheesy. There is no better feeling in the world than a warm pizza box on your lap. My love for Pizza is very high,and I'm boxer ,and I speak four language , and my favourite singer is ed sheeran and my favourite song is a shape of you.
