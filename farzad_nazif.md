My name is Farzad Nazif.
My favorite sport is mountain biking. I can ride the bike fast in downhill. It gives me goose bumps. Also, I can enjoy exploring the nature.
My favorite food is sandwich. Easy to make, super delicious and portable are the reasons why I love sandwiches.

An interesting fact about me: If I set a goal in my mind, there's no way I wouldn't achieve my goal. Working hard and with discipline until I meet my goals. In summary the strongest commitment for goals could be found in me !
