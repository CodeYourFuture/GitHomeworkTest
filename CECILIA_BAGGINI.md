## Cecilia Baggini

### My favourite sport:

Swimming, because I love being in the water (not in the swimming pool though).

### My favourite food

Too many to mention, but if I have to choose it's pizza, because it was what we went out to eat when I was little as a special treat.

### A song that I like

[Lacuna Coil - I won't tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTZFwLOoS1U)

### An interesting fact about myself

Part of my job is identifying river macroinvertebrates - mostly insect larvae. Aren't they cute?
