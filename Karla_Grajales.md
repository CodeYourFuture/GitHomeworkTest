Hi, my name is Karla Grajales :)  

my Favorite Sport is Cheerleading, I was a cheerleader for 11 years, and I like swimming, playing basketball, workout, I like challenges to bring your body until you said, I am dying. xd

This is one of the reasons why I enjoy to do cheerleading, you can fly literally, I can not describe the feeling when your body feels the adrenalin. Now I am swimming, It's the same, you can push your body every time a little more and you will feel happy seeing that you are progressing doing what you love.

My favorite food is Lasagna, tacos, and Hot dogs, I like cooking these kinds of food, and I am flying in my happiness hah hah. I think the best way to enjoy life is by doing sports and eating delicious food. 

I am Christian, I enjoy listening to music to feel more energetic praying to God. this is one of my favorite music videos.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awkO61T6i0k&ab_channel=BethelMusic

I did the European Cheer Union competition of Cheerleading, I won 1st place in Edinburgh and 3rd in Germany.

Now, I am looking forward to being successful in a career being a good Software Developer. :)
