👋 Hiya, my name is Keenan Powell, great to meet you!
🏐 My all-time favourite sport is volleyball — there’s just something about the fast pace, the teamwork, and that satisfying smack of a clean spike that keeps me hooked.

🍰 When it comes to food, cake takes the crown. Whether it’s chocolate, red velvet, or carrot — it’s happiness in slice form. Simple as that.

🎵 I’m into music that hits with soul and energy — check out one of my favourite bands, Red Hot Chili Peppers:

🏃‍♂️ I’ve recently taken up running trails and long-distance running — I’m looking forward to training for a marathon someday!
