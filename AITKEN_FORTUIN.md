Introdction

Hello all whom are reading this, my name is Aitken, my current favorite sport-
would have to be rugby as I do not believe gaming has been recognized as a sport-
despite the existence of E-Sports

My favourite food is Pasta, mainly big on Lasagne, I love the taste of it and-
I am pretty big on cheese

An Interesting fact about me : when I was a kid a woman accidentally drove over-
my toes with her car, I didnt feel a thing, for a short time I was convinced-
that I was invincible
