My name is **Tony Beaumont**

My favourite sport is cycling because teams are made up of people whose only role is to help the star of the team to win

My favourite food is pasta because there are so many different varieties and seafood pasta is delicious

An interesting fact about me is I play Tenor sax in the Band of the West Midlands Fire Service.
