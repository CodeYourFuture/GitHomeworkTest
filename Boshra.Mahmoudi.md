My name is Boshra

my favorite sport is hiking, It helps me relax and also it is a good opportunity to spend time and have chat with family and friends.

my favorite food is BBQ chicken and meet because it is easy and made in outside

An interesting thing about me is that when I want something I keep trying patiently to achieve it. No matter how they are small or big I will reach to my goals.
