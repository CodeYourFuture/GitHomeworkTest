Hello My Name is Tandy Nicole, which is short for Thandiwe Matikiti
I love Rugby because its a fast and exciting sport than most common sports. Its easily accessible I get to watch it live in Edinburgh, at Murrayfield Stadium.
My favourte food is Thai Food. I love how the flavours blend well with a mix of savoury and sweet food. I love the sources and the vegetarian options.
Here is a Youtube link to my favourite music: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=amapiano+mix+2021
An interesting fact about me is i am very shy and yet so confident in nature. I am a natural public speaker, I love to command presence and to speak in front of people. But I am an introvert, love to connect with people on a 1 to 1 level.
