Hi! My name is Yuliya. 
My favourite sport is badminton because this game is very mobile and it involves all the muscles of the body and the brain!
From food my favorite right now is healthy food like avocado toast, broccoli with cream, eggs. Such food is very tasty if it is prepared correctly and is incredibly nutritions, giving energy for the whole day!
