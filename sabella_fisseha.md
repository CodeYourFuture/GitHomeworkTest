Hello, I am Sabella Fisseha. I am die hard fan of football, and i support Manchester United ever since I was little. I love football because it brings families, friends together.
My favorite food is DORO WOT, eritrean best dish. I love it because it reminds me home.
This is a YouTube link to my favorite music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsfVYQ8zd4M
Fun fact about me- I look more pakistani than eritrean.
