i. About Shafiek Davids

ii. My favourite sport has always been Formula 1. Although not an avid follower of the sport of recent, it still remains the one sport which I might take time out to watch.
I like this sport for its pushing the boundaries in technology. A small change can make a huge difference in the overall results.

iii. My favourite food would have to be fried chicken, but only the way my wife makes it.
