My name is Waleed Al-Rwaishan.
My favorite sport is Speed Skating.
My favorite food is Yemeni Salta. It is a flavored stew with various ingredients eaten with a special type of bread. It is quiet similar to Balti, but it has a distinctive taste.
I do find the music of Fasil Alwi moving especially this song on the link below:

I did pass my theory for HGV driving and done practical lessons, but failed my practical test. I wanted to continue, but it was very expensive for me.
