Hi, my name is Terry Calderbank

My favourite sport is football but unfortunately I support Everton so have had to endure decades of suffering.

My favourite food is Curry as I like spicy food and I particularly enjoy a trip to the curry mile in Rusholme.

One of my favourite tracks is Superstyling by Groove Armarda:

My interesting fact is that I joined the Royal Marines at 18 and served for 7 years until I was medically discharged after an abseiling accident.
