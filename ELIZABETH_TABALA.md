Hey there! 
My name is Elizabeth Tabala, or Liza for short. I can't name my favourite sport or food because there are so many different ones, how one can love just one?? For example, I like watching football, but only big competitions like FIFA or World Cup. I also liked playing it when I was little. But I also like swimming, very much. Why do I like it? I don't know. I just like diving, so the whole hectic world is "outside", and I can't hear it. 
As for the food, I also can't tell you just one I love. But there's one I've been loving since my childhood. It's russian pancakes. Basically, it's like crepes that different European countries have as well, but somehow, russian ones called that way.

Here's one of my favourite songs from one of my favourite singers, Mahmood <3
One interesting fact about me: once I was working as a lifeguard at the States. I saved two drowning little boys, but not that I wasn't given a bonus (it's okay, I'm happy that I saved lives), but I was fired very soon after that *a clown emoji*
