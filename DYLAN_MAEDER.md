Hi, my name is Dylan Maeder and this is my introduction "readme" :)

My favourite sport:

My favourite sport is Bodyboarding and I absolutely love the thrill of getting barrled and riding waves.
I have been bodyboarding since I was about 8 years old and I have.. pretty much lived in the sea since then!

Favourite Food:

My favourite food is probably my staple diet which is chicken, rice and veg. I eat this combo on a daily basis as I mainly eat for healthy purposes. I do add in diffferent spices and flavors so it isnt boring every time :P.
But if I have a fun and good meal, then a deep fried fish and chips is my FAVOURITE! The salt and vinegar gets me excited!

Favourite Music:

I like metal/punk/rock type of music. 
I have linked this video as an example:

Funfact:

An interesting fact about me is that I was actually a metal vocalist haha. I have quite a range of vocals in the "metal" range and scene.
