Your favourite sport and why you like it

My favourite sport is Basketball. I always like playing this sport since I was young. I'm not really sure why I like it but I know that when I play I find a sense of joy and hapiness. 

Your favourite food and why it's your favourite

My favourite food is a dish from my country "Haiti". The disk is made with rice and peas with either meat or fish. It's similar to the Jamaican rice and peas. Why i like it? It's because it is very tasty.
