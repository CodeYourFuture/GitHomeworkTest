Hi everyone! My name is Jonathan Boahene. My favourite sport is football because it brings people together, teaches teamwork, and gives me a great adrenaline rush—whether I’m playing or watching (fun-fact: wanted to be a footballer growning up). When it comes to food, I absolutely love jollof rice. It’s spicy, full of flavour, and reminds me of home and family gatherings.

Here’s a link to a video of my favourite music: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95JjRriy_Z8&list=OLAK5uy_kSPQ328oLxvkuNh40VWAGtjUquBcuT9AQ&index=1&ab_channel=BlackSherifVEVO).

An interesting fact about me? I grew up in a small village without electricity, but that never stopped me from dreaming big. Today, I hold a master’s degree in data science and continue to chase goals that once seemed impossible.
