# Elisha Mesquitta, Hi!
My name is Elisha Mesquitta.
My favourite sport is rounders, as it is a team sport and it has a lot of elements to the game.
I don't have a favourite food as there are too many to mention but If I was to choose, it would be apple crumble crumble and custard.

I would like to learn operatic singing.
