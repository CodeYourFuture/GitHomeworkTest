My name is Ntshumayelo Matho
I like F1 formula racing. Apart from the excitement of racing, the rivalries etc. the main reason I like to watch F1 is the technology and the team work that goes with it. It is what differentiates F1 from other forms of motorsport.
Anything Chicken is my favorite, along with rice and veggies. I like this food because its healthy for our bodies. Lean protein plus lots of vegetables equals a simple, nutritious meal.

An interesting fact about me is that I've been playing keyboard for my church since the age of 13.
