My favourite sport is football because its a sport that i have been playing ever since at the age of 5. I enjoy the sociable aspects and the tactical side of the game. 
My favourite food is a dutch fast food meal called patatje oorlog, which literally means, " war fries" that is topped with special mayonnaise, chopped up mini onions and another special sauce that is called satay sauce, in other words, peanut sauce.
