Hi,
My name is Morteza Khojasteh,
My favourite sport is kickboxing. Kickboxing is an intense workout that forces your heart to remain in good shape. An increased heart rate will ensure that all your body parts are well oxygenated, helping them function at the optimum levels. Besides, you will also be able to burn calories, hence keep your body in check. ÙŒWhen I was young I had many championships in this field. When I entered the battlefield, I had an incredible feeling.
My favourite food is Kebab, Kebabs are loved by everyone because of their aroma and tender and juicy flavour, it is the most versatile dishes ever.
My favourite music is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLQl3WQQoQ0,
I think Adele's 'Someone Like You' is one of the most heartbreaking breakups love songs of all time.
My interesting facts are that I had many failures in life, but I didn't ever give up, I am a very diligent person and I try to achieve my goals.
