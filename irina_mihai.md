My name is Irina Mihai.

I don't really have a favorite sport at the moment due to lack of time, but when I was young I was enjoying to play chess. As a hobby I prefer to watch movies.
My favorite food is Pizza, who doesn't love Pizza?
I like pizza because you can cook it in many ways, you always can add everything you like.
I have many favorite dishes like lasagna, cottage-pie.

Not my favorite but one of the songs I like.

An interesting about me? I am proud of myself that I obtained the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certificate, this is my recent achievement. I want to learn more about coding, programming, and maybe when I get enough experience I can learn more about cyber security.
