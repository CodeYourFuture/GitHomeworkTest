My name is Irina Mihai.
I don't really have a favorite sport at the moment due to lack of time, but when I was young I was enjoying to play chess. But I would like one day to learn swimming.
My favorite food is Pizza, who doesn't love Pizza? 
I like pizza because you cook it in many ways.
I also like to eat hamburgers. I also like some chinese food. I usually try to eat healthy vegetables, but once in a while we deserve to spoil ourselves.
Not my favorite but one of the songs I like.

An interesting about me? I am proud of myself that I obtained the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certificate, this is my recent achievement. I want to learn more about coding, programming, and maybe when I get enough experience I can learn more about cyber security..
