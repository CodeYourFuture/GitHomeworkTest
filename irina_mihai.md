My name is Irina Mihai.
I don't really have a favorite sport at the moment due to lack of time, but when I was young I was enjoying to play chess, run every evening. But I would like to try in the future diving.
My favorite food is Pizza, who doesn't love Pizza?. I also like to eat hamburgers. I also like some chinese food. I usually try to eat healthy vegetables, but once in a while we deserve to spoil ourselves.
Not my favorite but one of the songs I like.

An interesting about me? I am proud of myself that I obtained the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certificate, this is my recent qualification. I want one day to learn more about Artificial Intelligence.
