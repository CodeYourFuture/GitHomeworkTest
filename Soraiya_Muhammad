About Me!

1. Name
Soraiya

2. My favourite sport and why I like it
My favourite sport to watch is Tennis, as I find it the most engaging and easy to follow. However, my favourite sport to play is definitely badminton, because a court isn't necessarily needed for playing, so you can play pretty much anywhere with space as and the right equipment.

3. My favourite food and why it's my favourite
Seafood is my favourite food because of it's versatility. When making recipes, it can be enjoyed all kinds of ways. Some of my favourite seafood dishes are: Sushi, seafood boils, stir fries and baked fish.

5. An interesting fact about me
I once got a chance to be at my favourite artist Beyonce's On The Run Tour concert free of charge, with a front stage view...this was by working at one of the kiosks through an event agency, and was definitely worth it :)
