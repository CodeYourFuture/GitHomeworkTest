horse riding: I like the connection with the animal. The power of the horse is a unit of measurement I respect for a reason. They could trample us at any time really. I fear that power and respect it.

thyme and garlic coated roasted duck legs with chips and sweet red wine cooked cabage. The textures and flavours compliment each other, not to mention the nutritional value.

I am not interesting at all and I care not for impressing others.
