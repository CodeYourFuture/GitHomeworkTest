1. Name: Anza Azam.
2. Favourite Sport: Cricket , it is my favourite sport because it has been played across the world since many decades. There are many competitive teams around the globe which participate in the worldcup and play matches in a friendly environment. It brings world together and countries enjoy peace along with the games. It is very dynamic game where sometime till the end it keeps suspense within itself that which team will win the game and that is the exciting part in this sport. I have enjoyed this game in every form, such as watching on the tv, watching teams play in the ground or even when I play myself with my family on casual weekends.
3.
