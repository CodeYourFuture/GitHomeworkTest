1. Your name
A. Anosh Malik

2. Your favourite sport and why you like it
A. Football - because it involves all kinds of exercises. Cardio and
resistance both. To be the best you have to be versatile and 
developed in all aspects of the human anatomy.
Also because Cristiano Ronaldo has elevated the sport 
single-handedly throughout the globe, it just makes it more alluring to watch the game when the legend is playing, breaking all past records. 


3. Your favourite food and why it's your favourite
A. My favourite food is pizzas. The fact that its quick and can be made with many different variations i.e Chicken, Pepperoni, QuattroFormaggi etc. Again, it's variable and doesnt keep you bored. I can always change toppings, making it a mixture of carbs, protein, and fat which are necessary to maintain a balanced diet.

4. A link to a video of your favourite music
