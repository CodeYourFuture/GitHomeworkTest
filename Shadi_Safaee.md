My name is Shadi My favourite sport is vollyball. Ive been playing vollybal since I was a child. Its a very exciting experience to play with my team mates. I think its also a great social activity. I like cooking so much. This is one of my hobbies. I enjoy cooking, sometimes everyday, and there are some international reciepes I memorized by heart. My favourite dish is Kobideh Kabab. Its a Persian food and absolutely delicious. Sadly, its not easy for me to make it as perfect as the ones that restaurants cook. I also enjoy listening to music. Like everyone not every music is my type. If I am supposed to choose only one song to listen, it will definitely be the song "Imagine" by John Lennon. Im sure that almost everyone has heared of this song. If you haven`t, please follow this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8 I have big dreams in my life. One of them is being able to have my own painting exhibition in London by which I can show some of my acrylic paintings to the public. My family and friends know me as a person who never gives up at difficult times of life. However, what I always remind myself through life ahead is being a human and kind to people.
