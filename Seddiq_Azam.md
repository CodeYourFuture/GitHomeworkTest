My name is Seddiq Azam

I like to play Cricket, because is a dynamic and exciting sport. It offers a blend of strategy and teamwork, which makes it engaging and enjoyable for both players and spectators. 

I like Afghan food, because its known for its rich flavours, aromatic spices and heartly ingredient. Afghan food emphases the use of fresh ingredients and often included herbs such as coriander and mint, as well as spices such as cumin and cardamom.
