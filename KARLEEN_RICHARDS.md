Hello,

I am Karleen Richards, I'm from a twin island called Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean.

Though our country maybe mostly known for football, athletics and even cricket, my favorite sport is basketball. It is fast paced and exciting and that's why I love it. My passion for the sport grew over the years and I was so caught up in the sport that my son's name was inspired by LeBron James aka King James, my son is called Jebron.

The population in my home country is roughly 40% East Indian, 40% African and the rest split between a few other ethnic groups. Curry is an ingredient often used in Indian Delicacies and the tradition was brought to our shores many years ago by the East Indians. A "good curry" is enjoyed by everyone in my country. My favorite food is buss up shot with curry chicken and potatoes. 

Of lately I have been very much interested in and entertained by afrobeats. I love the dancing and the sound of the rhythmic beats hence at this moment my favorite video is Rush by Ayra Starr, Feel free to check the video out here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crtQSTYWtqE).

I am very much interested in home DIY projects and I like decorating. For me, it is inevitable to decorate without tweeking something into the version that I want it in. For example, changing the color of something using acrylic paint. Doing DIY's also help me relieve stress.

I hope this was a fun read!
