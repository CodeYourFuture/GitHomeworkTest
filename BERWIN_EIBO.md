# Introduction - Berwin Eibo

## About Me

Hello! My name is Berwin Eibo. I'm an avid badminton player and food enthusiast. I love exploring different cuisines and savoring each dish, as they bring back beautiful memories attached to them.

## Favorite Sport - Badminton

One of my favorite sports is badminton. I enjoy playing it in a group of four, as it creates a dynamic and competitive environment. Playing badminton helps me stay fit and focused, as I need to pay attention to the shuttlecock's movement and the players' actions simultaneously.

## Favorite Food - Mahashi

When it comes to food, I don't have one specific favorite because each dish is linked to a special memory. However, I have a soft spot for Mahashi, a Kurdish dish. It reminds me of my family when we used to live together, and it brings back memories of how we would gather all the neighbors to help us with the preparation. It's a dish that requires time and effort, but it's totally worth it.

## Favorite Music

I'm passionate about music, and I can't imagine my life without it. Each piece of my favorite music has its own time and situation to be enjoyed. When I'm excited and want to meditate, I listen to Mark Eliyahu. You can check out one of my favorite tracks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKKgzVhMgY).

## Interesting Fact

I always find it challenging to answer the question "What's an interesting fact about yourself?" I consider myself (based on what I've been told) not particularly skilled in technologies and scientific subjects. However, I'm determined to challenge myself and prove that I can learn and excel in IT. I believe that with dedication and perseverance, I'll impress you by the end of the course!

Thank you for getting to know me a little better. I'm looking forward to the exciting journey ahead!
