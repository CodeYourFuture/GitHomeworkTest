Kudakwashe Richard Shambare
Because of my poor eyesight I can't play contact sports so I love Chess because it's my favorite sport for me.
My favorite food is pasta with chicken stew. I love this dish because it's the best for my tongue among all dishes I have tried out.

People who I live with think that it's hard to learn a new language when you are an adult. The interesting part about myself is that I'm actually going against their belief as I am in the process of mastering a new language (Javascript).
