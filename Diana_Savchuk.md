My name is Diana.
My favourite sport is running, I like running because it provides many physical, mental and emotional bonuses that add brightness to everyday life.
In general, I really like delicious food and various sweets. But most of all I like traditional Ukrainian cuisine, borsch (beet soup), dumplings (boiled dough with filling), I also like Italian cuisine, lasagna, various types of pasta, pizza and risotto. I am also very addicted to sweets, chocolate cakes and various types of cakes are definitely my addiction.

My music taste changes depending on my mood so the songs can also be different, here is one of them:

Interesting fact about me:
I love diving, I have had 4 dives, one of which I saw a huge turtle and countless incredibly beautiful fish, and this is all despite the fact that I am afraid of the deep water.
