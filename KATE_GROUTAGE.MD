1: Hey! My name is Kate Groutage!
2 :My favourite sport is Archery, every Thursday I do a couple of hours of it and I love it. I'm slowly getting better as well :D
3: My favourite food is Curry! Any, it doesn't really matter. I just love the spice and flavour of Curry, it's just a really good meal to have no matter the mood, weather, anything. It's perfect :)
4: This is my favourite song right now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2EjeMx4bSg . It's "Bow Down" by I Prevail. I really want to watch these guys live as I think it would be an amazing night and an absolute banger of an experience.
5: An interesting fact about me? Alright, I think an interesting fact about me is just how many expensive hobbies I have - and definitely don't keep up with as much as I want. Games Workshop (I love painting miniatures), 3D printing (this goes hand in gand with model painting), I like making music (DAW'S are the most expensive thing ever lmao), and I think the most fun one in my opinion, I collect pins! This is the least expensive hobby but I love it, I love collecting and there are so many different pins by so many different makers to collect!!
