# 1: Your name

Hey! My name is Kate Groutage!

# 2: Your favourite sport and why you like it

My favourite sport is Archery, every Thursday I do a couple of hours of it and I love it. I'm slowly getting better as well :D

# 3: Your favourite food and why it's your favourite

My favourite food is Curry! Any, it doesn't really matter. I just love the spice and flavour of Curry, it's just a really good meal to have no matter the mood, weather, anything. It's perfect :)

# 4: A link to a video of your favourite music

This is my favourite song right now: https://youtu.be/n2EjeMx4bSg . It's "Bow Down" by I Prevail. I really want to watch these guys live as I think it would be an amazing night and an absolute banger of an experience.

My favourite album is: https://youtu.be/cDdvMnu5RoQ . This just needs attention. Architects are absolutely amazing, this whole album is full of bangers and I really want to watch them live. My favourite album right now just because of how good it is and how unique each song is. My favourite songs from it are: Black Lungs, Dead Butterflies and Dying is Absolutely Safe.

# 5: An interesting fact about yourself - impress us!

An interesting fact about me? Alright, I think an interesting fact about me is just how many expensive hobbies I have - and definitely don't keep up with as much as I want. Games Workshop (I love painting miniatures), 3D printing (this goes hand in gand with model painting), I like making music (DAW'S are the most expensive thing ever lmao), and I think the most fun one in my opinion, I collect pins! This is the least expensive hobby but I love it, I love collecting and there are so many different pins by so many different makers to collect!!
