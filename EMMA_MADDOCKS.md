Hello! My name is Emma.

I'm not a massive sports fan but I do enjoy hiking and paddleboarding as it helps me destress and get some well needed time away from my computer, as well as burn off the calories of my favourite food; a roast dinner. It has to be made by my mum though - it reminds me of 'home' and her mashed potato usually comes lump-free.

I have a very varied taste in music and what I listen to depends on what mood I am, but one of my all time favourite songs is this, it reminds me of my childhood where my Dad would play it in the car as he drove around making deliveries!

An interesting fact about me is that I like to learn to do everything myself; I have taught myself to fit carpets, built a bin shed from wood offcuts with no plan or guide, landscaped a garden, sewn miniature duvet covers for my daughters dolls house and many more random things! My motto is 'if they can do it, so can I'..
