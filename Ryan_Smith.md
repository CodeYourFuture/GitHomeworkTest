My name is Ryan Smith

My favourite sport is Cricket, to watch and Running, to do.

My favourite food is lasagne - it's just the perfect combination of cheese, pasta and meat.

One of my favourite artists at the moment - in the genre of quiet storm - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hYCmPBlmwc&list=PLbThTlyTdHwB10xvAJM_a6oMrL0NVAbf6&index=2 

Ineresting fact about me is that I sing well and initially wanted to go into the music industry, before studying.
