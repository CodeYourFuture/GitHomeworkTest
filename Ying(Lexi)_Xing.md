Hello, my name is Ying Xing but you can call me Lexi. 
My favourite sport is badminton because of several reasons such as: it helps me to stay fit and healthy, it helps me to destress, also I can play it with friends and have fun together.
My favourite food is noodles because it reminds me of home. 
Now this is a difficult one because I love music and there are so many of them that I love, but here's a link to one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozl3L9fhKtE
An interesting fact about myself is that I was a teacher back in China and then I decided to change my career path to something creative so I came to the uk to study design but here I am changing it to something even more adventurous and challenging. And hopefully this will help me build a better future.

Thank you for reading this and thank you for being there! We're all truly grateful to CYF and all the volunteers.
