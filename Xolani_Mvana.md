Hi, my name is Xolani Mvana from Johannesburg South Africa and it's always a pleasure to meet new peopleğŸ˜Š. My favourite sport is American football, mainly because of it's intensity and the collective adrenaline, from the training ground to real time matches. My favourite food is ğŸ¤” well i particularly have a fewğŸ˜… but to name one it would be chicken mayo sandwich on brownğŸ˜‹ and it's my favourite because of it's tender and sweet taste and because i like chicken and mayonnaiseğŸ˜…. This the link to my favourite music: https://youtu.be/Pc3PcD0K7qI . An interesting fact about me is that i read a lot of psychology material and it has helped me understand myself and other people better and anticipate human behaviour.
