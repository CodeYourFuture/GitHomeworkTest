My name is Virginie Clayton
My favourite sport is basketball. I like it because it has a lot of tricks and it is energetic game. I started playing it in my teen age with my schoolmate.
My favourite food is fish. It is soft and tasty nice to me.

I am social person. When I set a goal, I commit to it. I will never give up no matter how much I will struggle. I will keep trying until I get there.
I love adventure especially exploring the places!
I explored some forest and I went to Inverness in Scotland.
