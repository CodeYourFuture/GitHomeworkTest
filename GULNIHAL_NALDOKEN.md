Gulnihal
I generally don't do sports. I had aerobics and steps classes in the past. I like watching tennis matches.
My favourite food is Turkish dolma. It's easy to cook and very delicious and it's also one of my best recipies that I cook.

I've graduated from the top university of Turkey which accepts students who get the highest marks in the university entrance exam. (It's found quite impressive by people around me :) )
