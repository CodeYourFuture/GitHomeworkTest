I am Rahwa and I am originally from Eritrea. 
My favorite sport is Table Tennis because, my Dad is a table tennis coach and I used to go to watch matches with him since I was 6.
my favorite food is Eritrean food because it is so spicy.
here you have my favorite song  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDDMYw_IZnE .
I had a scholarship offer from Florida International University when I was in Eritrea but I came here because of love.
