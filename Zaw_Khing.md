My name is Zaw Khing.

My favourite sport is football. Because I enjoy playing football as well as watching the matches which give me excitment and can't never predict the scoreline. My favourite food is 'Nan Gyi Thote' which is our Burmese traditional noodle salad. I can taste different flavours in it and especially I quite like spicy bit. I don't have any kind of favouite music. But if i have to pick one, I am going to pick 'Rock' music. I listen to scorpion band these days and this is one of my favourite.

An interesting fun fact is that I sing all the time whether i am happy or sad. I think i have a good voice not in English, in my language.
