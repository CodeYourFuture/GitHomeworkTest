Hi My name is Mustaf Asani, my favourite sport is basketball and I like it because it is a high intensity fast paced sport which requires athletic ability and creativity. I feel like basketball is a sport that gives you a full workout. My favourite food is Pizza, meat feast to be exact. I like pizza because it tastes delicious even the day after. My favourite song is so will I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdIOaAvvOp8&ab_channel=CrossWorshipMusic, this version especially. I feel like this songs represents the essence of what it is to worship God and the awe inspiring works all round us are a testament to his wondrous nature. An interesting fact about me is I can only be fluent in 2 languages at a time, every time I learn a third language I will quickly forget one of the first 2 I originally knew. this has happened to me twice.
