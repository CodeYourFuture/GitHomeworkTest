My name is Aboboaker MohamedAli and my nickname is Bekoo, My favourite sport is Swimming because I've growen up in a warm weather country "Sudan", so I've been doing this sport daily because we go to sea offten. My favourite food is grilled checken with rice, and I like it because it's testy, healthy and easy to be cooked.
