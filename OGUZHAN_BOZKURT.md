Hello!! 
My name is Oguzhan Bozkurt. I came from Turkey and I have been in UK for almost 2 years. I am a person who like lots of sports so much. For example, I have black belt in Taekwondo and Kick Box, I did scuba diving, paragliding, rafting etc. In addition I like table tennis, volleyball and basketball. I like to be free and I feel free during this sports especially, scuba diving. My favourite foods are sirdan, kebap, manti. Why do I like this foods because, in my country, kebap is so famous food and I am like a cheef. One day we can go to picnic altogether and I can do kebap for all CYF. I like the instrumental music. I am not listen only my body during the listen this musics. My soul listens this music as well. You can find instrumental music in this link as well.
