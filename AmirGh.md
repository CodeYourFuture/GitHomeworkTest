I’m Payam Ghanbari (but go by Amir), a 35-year-old Iranian living in London, UK.

I’m passionate about fitness and hit the gym regularly, but my true love lies in hiking and mountaineering. Hiking lets me explore inaccessible places—ones often unreachable by car—while mountaineering rewards me with breathtaking landscapes and thrilling challenges, both of which I deeply enjoy.

I’m also a huge foodie and love all kinds of cooked meat, though BBQ is my absolute favorite. I’m not sure why, but I’m obsessed with the taste!

Here’s my favorite music video:

A fun fact about me: Sometimes—when the cost of failure is low—I deliberately choose the harder path, even if there’s an easier way, simply because I love challenges. I believe that’s where growth happens.
