Remi Marty

ii. Your fav sport and why you like it
I love kung fu because it's not just about the physical, it's also about mental and emotional discipline. It's like dancing and enables you to have complete control over your body.

iii. Your fav food and why it's your fav 
My favourite food is a vegan roast dinner. The gravy, yorkshire puddings, roast potatoes, stuffing, brussel sprouts, 'pigs' in blankets. It's my favourite because it just tastes so good and reminds me of how lucky I am to share the world with humans
