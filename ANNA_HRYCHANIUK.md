My favorite sport is Kung Fu, because it is a kind of gymnastic and self defense at the same time. And it looks really beautiful and amazing when you watch it performance from aside.
my favorite food is bread. I just adore taste of fresh warm bread. It tastes delicious with almost everything: sausages, jam, cheese and even itself with warm milk.

I love knitting and knit sweaters for me and my daughter.
