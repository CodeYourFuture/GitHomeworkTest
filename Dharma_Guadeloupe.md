Allow me to introduce myself, my name is actually double barrelled: Dharma-Emmelene but for the sake of brevity I go by Dharma. Only my friends and loved ones call me by my full name. Interesting side bar: my parents argue where the name Emmelene comes from .my mother is convinced that I'm named after the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, my father insists it's from a Hot Chocolate song! My surname is where my family hail from Guadeloupe.

As for sports, I don't like them. I enjoyed them in school. I was a sprinter/hurdler & captain of the hockey and football team. I only dedicated so much time to them as it allowed me to travel the country and skip classes like geography and maths. I kind of need maths now though, so maybe that wasn't such a great idea. 

My favourite food is Risotto, because it's so versatile. You can load it with whatever protein you enjoy. Provides you with lots of energy. As a fitness fanatic I find this useful.

My music tastes are eclectic at best. If had to choose a genre it would be rock in it's various forms. My favourite song of all time I've included

I don't remember who introduced me to this as a child but apparently I drove my parents mad with wanting to listen to it every day!

An interesting fact about me, I'm a twitch streamer. In fact the huge learning curve that comes from learning to stream reignited my passion for tech. When the pandemic hit, I found I wanted to find a way to turn my hobby into a career. I've pretty much failed as a streamer but I do enjoy spending hours a day in front of my 3 screens. A friend persuaded me to try coding and now I have a new passion that is still very much in my comfort zone. Now I can stream for pleasure again. It becomes a joyless thing when you become entrenched in the numbers and a desire to make money from what is essentially a hobby. It's a tough platform to stand out on with 3 million broadcasters.
