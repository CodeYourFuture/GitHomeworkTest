# Hi! I'm Amy-Rose ðŸ‘‹
Not just Amy, please. I like the whole thing: Amy-Rose!

I don't really like sport...does dance count? I love social dancing, though I don't get to go often. I've been doing swing dance recently, but also might pick up salsa and bachata again instead.

I'm terrible at picking a favourite food, but I'm really looking forward to eating a pizza after the in-person CYF class tomorrow.

[This is my favourite music video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&pp=ygUXbmV2ZXIgZ29ubmEgZ2l2ZSB5b3UgdXA%3D)

Hmmn, is it interesting that I dress like a children's TV presenter and also like metal music?
