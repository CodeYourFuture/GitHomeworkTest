My favourite sport is football, because you can paly it in anyplace, you don't need too complicated tools, a ball is enough to make you happy.
I like the cag kebab, it is a tradinital in my home town and I can assure you it is noy like kebab we are having here in the UK.

I can't sing, my voice is terrible.
