## About me
* Name
My name is Kwanda Silekwa.

* Favourite Sport
My favourite sport is football, i love fooball because it is a great method to keep in shape and stay healthy. It's also a grate method to keep up with social activities. Football is a popular sport all over the globe, and it may help circulate more blood, oxygen, and nutrients into the body, as well as boost your energy levels, improving your overall health.

* Favourite Food
Anything with ‘hot chips’ is my favourite for me! It can Fried fish with chips, a kota, gatsby,etc. I am not exactly sure why I love food with hot chips but I just do. I guess it has to do with the salt and vinegar because I love the taste and the smell of the vinegar on salt on the chips. So as long as my health does not forbid it I am game for any hot chips based food and I don’t have any particular favorites.

All that I ask is that it should be a hot hips based food.
